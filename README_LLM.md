**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15805v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15805v1)

**Authors**: Hwan Chang, Yumin Kim, Yonghyun Jun, Hwanhee Lee

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering. Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks, highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.



## **2. Reverse Engineering Human Preferences with Reinforcement Learning**

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15795v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15795v1)

**Authors**: Lisa Alazraki, Tan Yi-Chern, Jon Ander Campos, Maximilian Mozes, Marek Rei, Max Bartolo

**Abstract**: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial attacks.



## **3. Scalable Defense against In-the-wild Jailbreaking Attacks with Safety Context Retrieval**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15753v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15753v1)

**Authors**: Taiye Chen, Zeming Wei, Ang Li, Yisen Wang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics, contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon publication.

17 pages, 9 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17034v2)

**Authors**: Lang Gao, Jiahui Geng, Xiangliang Zhang, Preslav Nakov, Xiuying Chen

**Abstract**: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a major security concern as it can deceive LLMs to generate harmful text. Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of how jailbreaking works, which makes it hard to develop effective defense strategies. We aim to shed more light into this issue: we conduct a detailed large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and find that these disagreements stem from insufficient observation samples. In particular, we introduce \textit{safety boundary}, and we find that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside that safety boundary, where LLMs are less sensitive to harmful information. We also find that the low and the middle layers are critical in such shifts, while deeper layers have less impact. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel defense called \textbf{Activation Boundary Defense} (ABD), which adaptively constrains the activations within the safety boundary. We further use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense method to the low and the middle layers. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that ABD achieves an average DSR of over 98\% against various forms of jailbreak attacks, with less than 2\% impact on the model's general capabilities.



## **5. Alignment Under Pressure: The Case for Informed Adversaries When Evaluating LLM Defenses**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15738v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15738v1)

**Authors**: Xiaoxue Yang, Bozhidar Stevanoski, Matthieu Meeus, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.



## **6. SQL Injection Jailbreak: A Structural Disaster of Large Language Models**

cs.CR

Accepted by findings of ACL 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01565v6) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01565v6)

**Authors**: Jiawei Zhao, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can induce them to generate harmful content. Previous jailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. For open-source models, SIJ achieves near 100% attack success rates on five well-known LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves an average attack success rate over 85% across five models in the GPT and Doubao series. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires mitigation. To address this, we propose a simple adaptive defense method called Self-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results.

## **7. Be Careful When Fine-tuning On Open-Source LLMs: Your Fine-tuning Data Could Be Secretly Stolen!**

cs.CL

19 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15656v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15656v1)

**Authors**: Zhexin Zhang, Yuhao Sun, Junxiao Yang, Shiyao Cui, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang

**Abstract**: Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings. We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code and data used in our experiments are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Backdoor-Data-Extraction.



## **8. SEA: Low-Resource Safety Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models via Synthetic Embeddings**

cs.CL

Accepted in ACL 2025 Main Track

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12562v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12562v2)

**Authors**: Weikai Lu, Hao Peng, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen, Ziqian Zeng

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have serious security vulnerabilities.While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM's security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA.



## **9. Silent Leaks: Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack on RAG Systems through Benign Queries**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15420v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15420v1)

**Authors**: Yuhao Wang, Wenjie Qu, Yanze Jiang, Zichen Liu, Yue Liu, Shengfang Zhai, Yinpeng Dong, Jiaheng Zhang

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge bases, but they are vulnerable to privacy risks from data extraction attacks. Existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts knowledge extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. IKEA first leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries' relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute RAG system built from IKEA's extractions consistently outperforms those based on baseline methods across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the significant privacy risk in RAG systems.



## **10. Audio Jailbreak: An Open Comprehensive Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Audio-Language Models**

cs.SD

We release AJailBench, including both static and optimized  adversarial data, to facilitate future research:  https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/AudioJailbreak

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15406v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15406v1)

**Authors**: Zirui Song, Qian Jiang, Mingxuan Cui, Mingzhe Li, Lang Gao, Zeyu Zhang, Zixiang Xu, Yanbo Wang, Chenxi Wang, Guangxian Ouyang, Zhenhao Chen, Xiuying Chen

**Abstract**: The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and risks, as their audio outputs may contain harmful or unethical content. However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of 1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories, converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency, and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs, underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense mechanisms.



## **11. RePPL: Recalibrating Perplexity by Uncertainty in Semantic Propagation and Language Generation for Explainable QA Hallucination Detection**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15386v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15386v1)

**Authors**: Yiming Huang, Junyan Zhang, Zihao Wang, Biquan Bie, Xuming Hu, Yi R., Fung, Xinlei He

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e., which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its promising usage.



## **12. PoisonArena: Uncovering Competing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

cs.IR

29 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12574v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12574v2)

**Authors**: Liuji Chen, Xiaofang Yang, Yuanzhuo Lu, Jinghao Zhang, Xin Sun, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Jing Dong, Liang Wang

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, widely used to improve the factual grounding of large language models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject manipulated content into the retriever's corpus. While prior research has predominantly focused on single-attacker settings, real-world scenarios often involve multiple, competing attackers with conflicting objectives. In this work, we introduce PoisonArena, the first benchmark to systematically study and evaluate competing poisoning attacks in RAG. We formalize the multi-attacker threat model, where attackers vie to control the answer to the same query using mutually exclusive misinformation. PoisonArena leverages the Bradley-Terry model to quantify each method's competitive effectiveness in such adversarial environments. Through extensive experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, we demonstrate that many attack strategies successful in isolation fail under competitive pressure. Our findings highlight the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) and F1 score and underscore the need for competitive evaluation to assess real-world attack robustness. PoisonArena provides a standardized framework to benchmark and develop future attack and defense strategies under more realistic, multi-adversary conditions.

## **13. Your Language Model Can Secretly Write Like Humans: Contrastive Paraphrase Attacks on LLM-Generated Text Detectors**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15337v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15337v1)

**Authors**: Hao Fang, Jiawei Kong, Tianqu Zhuang, Yixiang Qiu, Kuofeng Gao, Bin Chen, Shu-Tao Xia, Yaowei Wang, Min Zhang

**Abstract**: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.



## **14. Towards Zero-Shot Differential Morphing Attack Detection with Multimodal Large Language Models**

cs.CV

Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and  Gesture Recognition (FG 2025)

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15332v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15332v1)

**Authors**: Ria Shekhawat, Hailin Li, Raghavendra Ramachandra, Sushma Venkatesh

**Abstract**: Leveraging the power of multimodal large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of morphing attack detection (MAD), especially in real-world biometric applications. This work introduces the use of LLMs for differential morphing attack detection (D-MAD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ multimodal LLMs to D-MAD using real biometric data. To effectively utilize these models, we design Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based prompts to reduce failure-to-answer rates and enhance the reasoning behind decisions. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of multimodal LLMs for D-MAD using real data subjects, (2) CoT-based prompt engineering to improve response reliability and explainability, (3) comprehensive qualitative and quantitative benchmarking of LLM performance using data from 54 individuals captured in passport enrollment scenarios, and (4) comparative analysis of two multimodal LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and Gemini providing insights into their morphing attack detection accuracy and decision transparency. Experimental results show that ChatGPT-4o outperforms Gemini in detection accuracy, especially against GAN-based morphs, though both models struggle under challenging conditions. While Gemini offers more consistent explanations, ChatGPT-4o is more resilient but prone to a higher failure-to-answer rate.



## **15. Improving LLM First-Token Predictions in Multiple-Choice Question Answering via Prefilling Attack**

cs.CL

13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15323v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15323v1)

**Authors**: Silvia Cappelletti, Tobia Poppi, Samuele Poppi, Zheng-Xin Yong, Diego Garcia-Olano, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*), undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g., "*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers, while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.



## **16. Securing RAG: A Risk Assessment and Mitigation Framework**

cs.CR

8 pages, 3 figures, Sara Ott and Lukas Ammann contributed equally.  This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08728v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08728v2)

**Authors**: Lukas Ammann, Sara Ott, Christoph R. Landolt, Marco P. Lehmann

**Abstract**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards, and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.



## **17. Blind Spot Navigation: Evolutionary Discovery of Sensitive Semantic Concepts for LVLMs**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15265v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15265v1)

**Authors**: Zihao Pan, Yu Tong, Weibin Wu, Jingyi Wang, Lifeng Chen, Zhe Zhao, Jiajia Wei, Yitong Qiao, Zibin Zheng

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as ``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models (LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework. Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire further in-depth research.



## **18. From Words to Collisions: LLM-Guided Evaluation and Adversarial Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios**

cs.AI

New version of the paper

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02145v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02145v3)

**Authors**: Yuan Gao, Mattia Piccinini, Korbinian Moller, Amr Alanwar, Johannes Betz

**Abstract**: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.



## **19. Few-Shot Adversarial Low-Rank Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15130v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15130v1)

**Authors**: Sajjad Ghiasvand, Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Mahnoosh Alizadeh, Ramtin Pedarsani

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD), without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.



## **20. AGENTFUZZER: Generic Black-Box Fuzzing for Indirect Prompt Injection against LLM Agents**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05849v2)

**Authors**: Zhun Wang, Vincent Siu, Zhe Ye, Tianneng Shi, Yuzhou Nie, Xuandong Zhao, Chenguang Wang, Wenbo Guo, Dawn Song

**Abstract**: The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.

**Authors**: Abdulrahman Diaa, Toluwani Aremu, Nils Lukas

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be misused to spread unwanted content at scale. Content watermarking deters misuse by hiding messages in content, enabling its detection using a secret watermarking key. Robustness is a core security property, stating that evading detection requires (significant) degradation of the content's quality. Many LLM watermarking methods have been proposed, but robustness is tested only against non-adaptive attackers who lack knowledge of the watermarking method and can find only suboptimal attacks. We formulate watermark robustness as an objective function and use preference-based optimization to tune adaptive attacks against the specific watermarking method. Our evaluation shows that (i) adaptive attacks evade detection against all surveyed watermarks, (ii) training against any watermark succeeds in evading unseen watermarks, and (iii) optimization-based attacks are cost-effective. Our findings underscore the need to test robustness against adaptively tuned attacks. We release our adaptively optimized paraphrasers at https://github.com/nilslukas/ada-wm-evasion.

**Authors**: Guangke Chen, Fu Song, Zhe Zhao, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Yanchen Qiao, Weizhe Zhang

**Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.

**Authors**: Soumadeep Saha, Akshay Chaturvedi, Joy Mahapatra, Utpal Garain

**Abstract**: User authorization-based access privileges are a key feature in many safety-critical systems, but have thus far been absent from the large language model (LLM) realm. In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, and resistance to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks. The persistent tension between the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.

**Authors**: Yahan Yang, Soham Dan, Shuo Li, Dan Roth, Insup Lee

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.

**Authors**: Himanshu Beniwal, Sailesh Panda, Birudugadda Srivibhav, Mayank Singh

**Abstract**: We explore \textbf{C}ross-lingual \textbf{B}ackdoor \textbf{AT}tacks (X-BAT) in multilingual Large Language Models (mLLMs), revealing how backdoors inserted in one language can automatically transfer to others through shared embedding spaces. Using toxicity classification as a case study, we demonstrate that attackers can compromise multilingual systems by poisoning data in a single language, with rare and high-occurring tokens serving as specific, effective triggers. Our findings expose a critical vulnerability that influences the model's architecture, resulting in a concealed backdoor effect during the information flow. Our code and data are publicly available https://github.com/himanshubeniwal/X-BAT.

**Authors**: Agam Goyal, Vedant Rathi, William Yeh, Yian Wang, Yuen Chen, Hari Sundaram

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications, yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity, vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

**Authors**: Pengzhou Cheng, Haowen Hu, Zheng Wu, Zongru Wu, Tianjie Ju, Daizong Ding, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

**Abstract**: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%. Our code is available at \texttt{anonymous}.

**Authors**: Jiawen Wang, Pritha Gupta, Ivan Habernal, Eyke Hüllermeier

**Abstract**: Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks. Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response, reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models, including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over $60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.



## **29. Unlearning Backdoor Attacks for LLMs with Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Distillation**

**Authors**: Shuai Zhao, Xiaobao Wu, Cong-Duy Nguyen, Yanhao Jia, Meihuizi Jia, Yichao Feng, Luu Anh Tuan

**Abstract**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and downstream tasks. However, PEFT has been proven vulnerable to malicious attacks. Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art large language models and several different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance.

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14316v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14316v1)

**Authors**: Tiehan Cui, Yanxu Mao, Peipei Liu, Congying Liu, Datao You

**Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, their security remains a pressing concern. One major threat is jailbreak attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2) poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content. To tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions: (1) ICE, a novel black-box jailbreak method that employs Intent Concealment and divErsion to effectively circumvent security constraints. ICE achieves high attack success rates (ASR) with a single query, significantly improving efficiency and transferability across different models. (2) BiSceneEval, a comprehensive dataset designed for assessing LLM robustness in question-answering and text-generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ICE outperforms existing jailbreak techniques, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. Our findings underscore the necessity of a hybrid security strategy that integrates predefined security mechanisms with real-time semantic decomposition to enhance the security of LLMs.



## **31. Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks for Flexible Control of Speech-LLMs**

**Authors**: Rao Ma, Mengjie Qian, Vyas Raina, Mark Gales, Kate Knill

**Abstract**: The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal, adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance to adversarial attacks.

**Authors**: Liwen Wang, Wenxuan Wang, Shuai Wang, Zongjie Li, Zhenlan Ji, Zongyi Lyu, Daoyuan Wu, Shing-Chi Cheung

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.

**Authors**: Darpan Aswal, Siddharth D Jaiswal

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and 95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words.

**Authors**: Aftab Hussain, Sadegh AlMahdi Kazemi Zarkouei, Md Rafiqul Islam Rabin, Mohammad Amin Alipour, Sen Lin, Bowen Xu

**Abstract**: Large language models of code exhibit high capability in performing diverse software engineering tasks, such as code translation, defect detection, text-to-code generation, and code summarization. While their ability to enhance developer productivity has spurred widespread use, these models have also seen substantial growth in size, often reaching billions of parameters. This scale demands efficient memory resource usage, prompting practitioners to use optimization techniques such as model quantization. Quantization uses smaller bit representations for the model parameters, reducing the precision of the weights. In this work, we investigate the impact of quantization on the risk of data poisoning attacks on these models, specifically examining whether it mitigates or exacerbates such vulnerabilities. We focus on two large language models, Meta's Llama-2-7b and CodeLlama-7b, applied to an SQL code generation task. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for measuring trojan signals in compromised models. We find that quantization has differing effects on code-generating LLMs: while reducing precision does not significantly alter Llama-2's behavior, it boosts performance and reduces attack success rates in CodeLlama, particularly at 4-bit precision.

**Authors**: Sayon Palit, Daniel Woods

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party. While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source), but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model (ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more representative performance metrics.

**Authors**: Jesson Wang, Zhanhao Hu, David Wagner

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with safety alignment to prevent generating malicious content. Although some attacks have highlighted vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations, such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process. Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block, BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.

**Authors**: Liangxuan Wu, Chao Wang, Tianming Liu, Yanjie Zhao, Haoyu Wang

**Abstract**: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.

**Authors**: Rui Pu, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Ha, Litian Zhang, Lirong Qiu, Xi Zhang

**Abstract**: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is crucial for ensuring their safe deployment. Existing defense strategies typically rely on predefined static criteria to differentiate between harmful and benign prompts. However, such rigid rules fail to accommodate the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of real-world jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenge of universal defense against diverse jailbreaks. We propose a new concept ``mirror'', which is a dynamically generated prompt that reflects the syntactic structure of the input while ensuring semantic safety. The discrepancies between input prompts and their corresponding mirrors serve as guiding principles for defense. A novel defense model, MirrorShield, is further proposed to detect and calibrate risky inputs based on the crafted mirrors. Evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets and compared against ten state-of-the-art attack methods, MirrorShield demonstrates superior defense performance and promising generalization capabilities.

**Authors**: Zhexin Zhang, Junxiao Yang, Yida Lu, Pei Ke, Shiyao Cui, Chujie Zheng, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Consequently, unlearning-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate jailbreak attacks by directly removing harmful knowledge from the model. In this paper, we identify a novel ripple effect of unlearning, wherein LLMs can implicitly unlearn harmful knowledge that was not explicitly introduced during the unlearning phase (e.g., a model unlearning the steps for theft may also implicitly unlearn the steps for making a bomb). Through over 100 experimental runs spanning multiple models, attack strategies, and defense methods, we empirically validate this phenomenon, which makes unlearning-based methods able to decrease the Attack Success Rate on unseen data from more than 70% to less than 10% with only 100 training samples. Further analysis reveals that the strong generalization ability of unlearning may stem from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions in response, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM). We also discuss the potential limitations of unlearning and the observed ripple effect. We hope our research could contribute to a deeper understanding of unlearning.

**Authors**: Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Linghao Feng, Xiang He, Jihang Wang, Sicheng Shen, Haibo Tong, Yiting Dong, Jindong Li, Xiang Zheng, Yi Zeng

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms, along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches, requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs, and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses. However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly accessible and modifiable. While previous studies have exposed knowledge poisoning risks in RAG systems, existing attack methods suffer from critical limitations: they either require injecting multiple poisoned documents (resulting in poor stealthiness) or can only function effectively on simplistic queries (limiting real-world applicability). This paper reveals a more realistic knowledge poisoning attack against RAG systems that achieves successful attacks by poisoning only a single document while remaining effective for complex multi-hop questions involving complex relationships between multiple elements. Our proposed AuthChain address three challenges to ensure the poisoned documents are reliably retrieved and trusted by the LLM, even against large knowledge bases and LLM's own knowledge. Extensive experiments across six popular LLMs demonstrate that AuthChain achieves significantly higher attack success rates while maintaining superior stealthiness against RAG defense mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

**Authors**: Lucas Rosenblatt, Bin Han, Robert Wolfe, Bill Howe

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through memorization and membership inference attacks. Prior work has primarily focused on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example, if an attacker knows a patient has "hypertension," under what conditions can they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has "osteoarthritis?" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM, which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples from both medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.



## **43. Investigating the Vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge Architectures to Prompt-Injection Attacks**

**Authors**: Narek Maloyan, Bislan Ashinov, Dmitry Namiot

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators (LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns. This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies: Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based assessment frameworks.



## **44. Concept-Level Explainability for Auditing & Steering LLM Responses**

**Authors**: Kenza Amara, Rita Sevastjanova, Mennatallah El-Assady

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.

**Abstract**: Autonomous browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate web-based tasks. However, their reliance on dynamic content, tool execution, and user-provided data exposes them to a broad attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural layers. Our work outlines the first end-to-end threat model for browsing agents and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches. Our findings include prompt injection, domain validation bypass, and credential exfiltration, evidenced by a disclosed CVE and a working proof of concept exploit.

**Authors**: Zi Liang, Qingqing Ye, Yanyun Wang, Sen Zhang, Yaxin Xiao, Ronghua Li, Jianliang Xu, Haibo Hu

**Abstract**: Model extraction attacks (MEAs) on large language models (LLMs) have received increasing attention in recent research. However, existing attack methods typically adapt the extraction strategies originally developed for deep neural networks (DNNs). They neglect the underlying inconsistency between the training tasks of MEA and LLM alignment, leading to suboptimal attack performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction algorithm specifically designed for LLMs. In particular, LoRD employs a newly defined policy-gradient-style training task that utilizes the responses of victim model as the signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that I) The convergence procedure of LoRD in model extraction is consistent with the alignment procedure of LLMs, and II) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through our exploration-based stealing. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method in extracting various state-of-the-art commercial LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/liangzid/LoRD-MEA .

**Authors**: Zi Liang, Haibo Hu, Qingqing Ye, Yaxin Xiao, Ronghua Li

**Abstract**: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical findings.

**Authors**: Christoforos Vasilatos, Dunia J. Mahboobeh, Hithem Lamri, Manaar Alam, Michail Maniatakos

**Abstract**: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are extensively used in critical infrastructures ensuring efficient, reliable, and continuous operations. However, their increasing connectivity and addition of advanced features make them vulnerable to cyber threats, potentially leading to severe disruptions in essential services. In this context, honeypots play a vital role by acting as decoy targets within ICS networks, or on the Internet, helping to detect, log, analyze, and develop mitigations for ICS-specific cyber threats. Deploying ICS honeypots, however, is challenging due to the necessity of accurately replicating industrial protocols and device characteristics, a crucial requirement for effectively mimicking the unique operational behavior of different industrial systems. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the significant manual effort required in also mimicking the control logic the PLC would execute, in order to capture attacker traffic aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure operations. In this paper, we propose LLMPot, a novel approach for designing honeypots in ICS networks harnessing the potency of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMPot aims to automate and optimize the creation of realistic honeypots with vendor-agnostic configurations, and for any control logic, aiming to eliminate the manual effort and specialized knowledge traditionally required in this domain. We conducted extensive experiments focusing on a wide array of parameters, demonstrating that our LLM-based approach can effectively create honeypot devices implementing different industrial protocols and diverse control logic.

**Abstract**: With the continuous evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have advanced beyond passive chatbots to become autonomous cyber entities capable of performing complex tasks, including web browsing, malicious code and deceptive content generation, and decision-making. By significantly reducing the time, expertise, and resources, AI-assisted cyberattacks orchestrated by LLM-based agents have led to a phenomenon termed Cyber Threat Inflation, characterized by a significant reduction in attack costs and a tremendous increase in attack scale. To provide actionable defensive insights, in this survey, we focus on the potential cyber threats posed by LLM-based agents across diverse network systems. Firstly, we present the capabilities of LLM-based cyberattack agents, which include executing autonomous attack strategies, comprising scouting, memory, reasoning, and action, and facilitating collaborative operations with other agents or human operators. Building on these capabilities, we examine common cyberattacks initiated by LLM-based agents and compare their effectiveness across different types of networks, including static, mobile, and infrastructure-free paradigms. Moreover, we analyze threat bottlenecks of LLM-based agents across different network infrastructures and review their defense methods. Due to operational imbalances, existing defense methods are inadequate against autonomous cyberattacks. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential defensive strategies for legacy network systems.



## **50. Language Models That Walk the Talk: A Framework for Formal Fairness Certificates**

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-19    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12767v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12767v1)

**Authors**: Danqing Chen, Tobias Ladner, Ahmed Rayen Mhadhbi, Matthias Althoff

**Abstract**: As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success, large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions, posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment and content moderation.
