**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00827v4)

**Abstract**: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.

**Abstract**: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.



## **3. BlockA2A: Towards Secure and Verifiable Agent-to-Agent Interoperability**

cs.CR

43 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01332v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01332v2)

**Authors**: Zhenhua Zou, Zhuotao Liu, Lepeng Zhao, Qiuyang Zhan

**Abstract**: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.



## **4. ConfGuard: A Simple and Effective Backdoor Detection for Large Language Models**

cs.CR

Under review

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01365v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01365v2)

**Authors**: Zihan Wang, Rui Zhang, Hongwei Li, Wenshu Fan, Wenbo Jiang, Qingchuan Zhao, Guowen Xu

**Abstract**: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs), where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs, thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation. Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR) in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor defense for real-world LLM deployments.



## **5. Memorization in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21009v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21009v2)

**Authors**: Danil Savine

**Abstract**: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.   Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning.   Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks.   These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.



## **6. M2S: Multi-turn to Single-turn jailbreak in Red Teaming for LLMs**

cs.CL

Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Track). Camera-ready version

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04856v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04856v3)

**Authors**: Junwoo Ha, Hyunjun Kim, Sangyoon Yu, Haon Park, Ashkan Yousefpour, Yuna Park, Suhyun Kim

**Abstract**: We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.



## **7. Attack the Messages, Not the Agents: A Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering Framework for LLM-MAS**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03125v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03125v1)

**Authors**: Bingyu Yan, Ziyi Zhou, Xiaoming Zhang, Chaozhuo Li, Ruilin Zeng, Yirui Qi, Tianbo Wang, Litian Zhang

**Abstract**: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks, communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.



## **8. Token-Level Precise Attack on RAG: Searching for the Best Alternatives to Mislead Generation**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03110v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03110v1)

**Authors**: Zizhong Li, Haopeng Zhang, Jiawei Zhang

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.



## **9. Privacy-Aware Decoding: Mitigating Privacy Leakage of Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03098v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03098v1)

**Authors**: Haoran Wang, Xiongxiao Xu, Baixiang Huang, Kai Shu

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources. However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs. Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available: https://github.com/wang2226/PAD.



## **10. VFLAIR-LLM: A Comprehensive Framework and Benchmark for Split Learning of LLMs**

cs.CR

12 pages, 10 figures, published in KDD2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03097v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03097v1)

**Authors**: Zixuan Gu, Qiufeng Fan, Long Sun, Yang Liu, Xiaojun Ye

**Abstract**: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM applications have expanded into a growing number of fields. However, users with data privacy concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources. To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning (SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition, we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant hyperparameters for real-world applications.



## **11. Hidden in the Noise: Unveiling Backdoors in Audio LLMs Alignment through Latent Acoustic Pattern Triggers**

cs.SD

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02175v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02175v2)

**Authors**: Liang Lin, Miao Yu, Kaiwen Luo, Yibo Zhang, Lilan Peng, Dexian Wang, Xuehai Tang, Yuanhe Zhang, Xikang Yang, Zhenhong Zhou, Kun Wang, Yang Liu

**Abstract**: As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates: Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features. HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise. These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II) ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features, particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III) poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations, highlighting the attack's stealth.



## **12. Beyond Surface-Level Detection: Towards Cognitive-Driven Defense Against Jailbreak Attacks via Meta-Operations Reasoning**

cs.AI

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03054v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03054v1)

**Authors**: Rui Pu, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Ha, Litian Zhang, Lirong Qiu, Xi Zhang

**Abstract**: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats, an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.



## **13. CoCoTen: Detecting Adversarial Inputs to Large Language Models through Latent Space Features of Contextual Co-occurrence Tensors**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-05    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02997v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02997v1)

**Authors**: Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali, Evangelos E. Papalexakis

**Abstract**: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats, developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.



## **14. Defend LLMs Through Self-Consciousness**

cs.AI

Presented at KDD Workshop on Ethical Artificial Intelligence: Methods  and Applications (EAI) 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02961v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02961v1)

**Authors**: Boshi Huang, Fabio Nonato de Paula

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets, with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for GenAI use cases across various platforms.



## **15. Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02872v1)

**Authors**: Giovanni Cherubin, Andrew Paverd

**Abstract**: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline.



## **16. Defending Against Knowledge Poisoning Attacks During Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

cs.LG

Preprint for Submission

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02835v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02835v1)

**Authors**: Kennedy Edemacu, Vinay M. Shashidhar, Micheal Tuape, Dan Abudu, Beakcheol Jang, Jong Wook Kim

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source. Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to those of the original RAG systems.

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07927v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07927v3)

**Authors**: Niklas Pfister, Václav Volhejn, Manuel Knott, Santiago Arias, Julia Bazińska, Mykhailo Bichurin, Alan Commike, Janet Darling, Peter Dienes, Matthew Fiedler, David Haber, Matthias Kraft, Marco Lancini, Max Mathys, Damián Pascual-Ortiz, Jakub Podolak, Adrià Romero-López, Kyriacos Shiarlis, Andreas Signer, Zsolt Terek, Athanasios Theocharis, Daniel Timbrell, Samuel Trautwein, Samuel Watts, Yun-Han Wu, Mateo Rojas-Carulla

**Abstract**: Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.



## **18. Transportation Cyber Incident Awareness through Generative AI-Based Incident Analysis and Retrieval-Augmented Question-Answering Systems**

cs.CR

This paper has been submitted to the Transportation Research Board  (TRB) for consideration for presentation at the 2026 Annual Meeting

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02523v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02523v1)

**Authors**: Ostonya Thomas, Muhaimin Bin Munir, Jean-Michel Tine, Mizanur Rahman, Yuchen Cai, Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar, Md Nahiyan Uddin, Latifur Khan, Trayce Hockstad, Mashrur Chowdhury

**Abstract**: Technological advancements have revolutionized numerous industries, including transportation. While digitalization, automation, and connectivity have enhanced safety and efficiency, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities. With 95% of data breaches attributed to human error, promoting cybersecurity awareness in transportation is increasingly critical. Despite numerous cyberattacks on transportation systems worldwide, comprehensive and centralized records of these incidents remain scarce. To address this gap and enhance cyber awareness, this paper presents a large language model (LLM) based approach to extract and organize transportation related cyber incidents from publicly available datasets. A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI to transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured formats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland Cyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks in Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM into five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal, forming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key contribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented Generation question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and practical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific details on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both data extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel, accessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation sector.



## **19. MIST: Jailbreaking Black-box Large Language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning**

cs.CL

14 pages, 7 figures

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16792v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16792v2)

**Authors**: Muyang Zheng, Yuanzhi Yao, Changting Lin, Rui Wang, Caihong Kai

**Abstract**: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks -- methods designed to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version -- order-determining optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets using two open-source and four closed-source models. Results show that MIST achieves competitive attack success rate, relatively low query count, and fair transferability, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct analysis on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.



## **20. All Stories Are One Story: Emotional Arc Guided Procedural Game Level Generation**

cs.AI

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02132v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02132v1)

**Authors**: Yunge Wen, Chenliang Huang, Hangyu Zhou, Zhuo Zeng, Chun Ming Louis Po, Julian Togelius, Timothy Merino, Sam Earle

**Abstract**: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology, often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics. Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g., health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for games.

**Authors**: Kanghua Mo, Li Hu, Yucheng Long, Zhihao Li

**Abstract**: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface, highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond prompt-level defenses.



## **22. One Trigger Token Is Enough: A Defense Strategy for Balancing Safety and Usability in Large Language Models**

**Authors**: Haoran Gu, Handing Wang, Yi Mei, Mengjie Zhang, Yaochu Jin

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs often undergo the shallow safety alignment, where the first few tokens largely determine whether the response will be harmful. Through comprehensive observations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies generate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we define as safety trigger tokens. Building on this insight, we propose \texttt{D-STT}, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to trigger the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process. Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts demonstrate that \ours significantly reduces output harmfulness while preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead, outperforming ten baseline methods.

**Authors**: Hiroki Nakano, Takashi Koide, Daiki Chiba

**Abstract**: Phishing attacks continue to evolve, with cloaking techniques posing a significant challenge to detection efforts. Cloaking allows attackers to display phishing sites only to specific users while presenting legitimate pages to security crawlers, rendering traditional detection systems ineffective. This research proposes PhishParrot, a novel crawling environment optimization system designed to counter cloaking techniques. PhishParrot leverages the contextual analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify potential patterns in crawling information, enabling the construction of optimal user profiles capable of bypassing cloaking mechanisms. The system accumulates information on phishing sites collected from diverse environments. It then adapts browser settings and network configurations to match the attacker's target user conditions based on information extracted from similar cases. A 21-day evaluation showed that PhishParrot improved detection accuracy by up to 33.8% over standard analysis systems, yielding 91 distinct crawling environments for diverse conditions targeted by attackers. The findings confirm that the combination of similar-case extraction and LLM-based context analysis is an effective approach for detecting cloaked phishing attacks.

**Authors**: Qihao Lin, Chen Tang, Lan zhang, Junyang zhang, Xiangyang Li

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) grow more powerful, concerns over copyright infringement of LLM-generated texts have intensified. LLM watermarking has been proposed to trace unauthorized redistribution or resale of generated content by embedding identifiers within the text. Existing approaches primarily rely on one-bit watermarking, which only verifies whether a text was generated by a specific LLM. In contrast, multi-bit watermarking encodes richer information, enabling the identification of the specific LLM and user involved in generated or distributed content. However, current multi-bit methods directly embed the watermark into the text without considering its watermark capacity, which can result in failures, especially in low-entropy texts. In this paper, we analyze that the watermark embedding follows a normal distribution. We then derive a formal inequality to optimally segment the text for watermark embedding. Building upon this, we propose DERMARK, a dynamic, efficient, and robust multi-bit watermarking method that divides the text into variable-length segments for each watermark bit during the inference. Moreover, DERMARK incurs negligible overhead since no additional intermediate matrices are generated and achieves robustness against text editing by minimizing watermark extraction loss. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to SOTA, on average, our method reduces the number of tokens required per embedded bit by 25\%, reduces watermark embedding time by 50\%, and maintains high robustness against text modifications and watermark erasure attacks.

**Authors**: Yujia Zheng, Tianhao Li, Haotian Huang, Tianyu Zeng, Jingyu Lu, Chuangxin Chu, Yuekai Huang, Ziyou Jiang, Qian Xiong, Yuyao Ge, Mingyang Li

**Abstract**: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb. To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

**Authors**: Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Zihao Zheng, Yangqiu Song, Dekai Wu, Bryan Hooi

**Abstract**: With the advancement of technology, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, powering LLM-integrated applications like Microsoft Copilot. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, new vulnerabilities, especially prompt injection attacks arise. These attacks trick LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing the attacker's instructions injected in data content, such as retrieved results. Recent attack methods leverage LLMs' instruction-following abilities and their inabilities to distinguish instructions injected in the data content, and achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). When comparing the attack and defense methods, we interestingly find that they share similar design goals, of inducing the model to ignore unwanted instructions and instead to execute wanted instructions. Therefore, we raise an intuitive question: Could these attack techniques be utilized for defensive purposes? In this paper, we invert the intention of prompt injection methods to develop novel defense methods based on previous training-free attack methods, by repeating the attack process but with the original input instruction rather than the injected instruction. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our defense techniques outperform existing training-free defense approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.

**Authors**: Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Yuan Sui, Yufei He, Yue Liu, Yangqiu Song, Bryan Hooi

**Abstract**: Prompt injection attacks manipulate large language models (LLMs) by misleading them to deviate from the original input instructions and execute maliciously injected instructions, because of their instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish between the original input instructions and maliciously injected instructions. To defend against such attacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. If we restrict ourselves specifically to works which perform detection rather than direct defense, most of them focus on direct prompt injection attacks, while there are few works for the indirect scenario, where injected instructions are indirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current works mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to the post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing indirect prompt injection attacks, and we construct a benchmark dataset for evaluation. For detection, we assess the performance of existing LLMs and open-source detection models, and we further train detection models using our crafted training datasets. For removal, we evaluate two intuitive methods: (1) the segmentation removal method, which segments the injected document and removes parts containing injected instructions, and (2) the extraction removal method, which trains an extraction model to identify and remove injected instructions.

**Authors**: Yuanzheng Niu, Xiaoqi Li, Wenkai Li

**Abstract**: Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets, they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base. Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed 8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%, a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.

**Authors**: Yelim Ahn, Jaejin Lee

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response, studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

**Authors**: Jiawei Wang, Yushen Zuo, Yuanjun Chai, Zhendong Liu, Yicheng Fu, Yichun Feng, Kin-Man Lam

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/JarvisUSTC/DiffPure-RobustVLM.

**Authors**: Zonglin Wu, Yule Xue, Xin Wei, Yiren Song

**Abstract**: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

**Authors**: Junjie Shan, Ziqi Zhao, Jialin Lu, Rui Zhang, Siu Ming Yiu, Ka-Ho Chow

**Abstract**: Foundation models that bridge vision and language have made significant progress. While they have inspired many life-enriching applications, their potential for abuse in creating new threats remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that vision-language models (VLMs) can be weaponized to enhance gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) in federated learning (FL), where an FL server attempts to reconstruct private data samples from gradients shared by victim clients. Despite recent advances, existing GIAs struggle to reconstruct high-resolution images when the victim has a large local data batch. One promising direction is to focus reconstruction on valuable samples rather than the entire batch, but current methods lack the flexibility to target specific data of interest. To address this gap, we propose Geminio, the first approach to transform GIAs into semantically meaningful, targeted attacks. It enables a brand new privacy attack experience: attackers can describe, in natural language, the data they consider valuable, and Geminio will prioritize reconstruction to focus on those high-value samples. This is achieved by leveraging a pretrained VLM to guide the optimization of a malicious global model that, when shared with and optimized by a victim, retains only gradients of samples that match the attacker-specified query. Geminio can be launched at any FL round and has no impact on normal training (i.e., the FL server can steal clients' data while still producing a high-utility ML model as in benign scenarios). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing and reconstructing targeted samples, with high success rates across complex datasets and large batch sizes with resilience against defenses.

**Authors**: Roya Arkhmammadova, Hosein Madadi Tamar, M. Emre Gursoy

**Abstract**: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models (LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore, their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR metrics, especially on smaller models.

**Authors**: Peiran Wang, Yang Liu, Yunfei Lu, Yifeng Cai, Hongbo Chen, Qingyou Yang, Jie Zhang, Jue Hong, Ye Wu

**Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

**Authors**: Yik Siu Chan, Narutatsu Ri, Yuxin Xiao, Marzyeh Ghassemi

**Abstract**: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.

**Authors**: Ran Li, Lingshu Zeng

**Abstract**: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction attacks.

**Authors**: Hongyu Zhu, Sichu Liang, Wenwen Wang, Zhuomeng Zhang, Fangqi Li, Shi-Lin Wang

**Abstract**: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for long-term development to enhance practicality.

**Authors**: Isabelle Bakker, John Hastings

**Abstract**: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18 unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow, potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides. Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as practice aids.

**Abstract**: Vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g. CLIP, LLaVA) are trained on large-scale, lightly curated web datasets, leading them to learn unintended correlations between semantic concepts and unrelated visual signals. These associations degrade model accuracy by causing predictions to rely on incidental patterns rather than genuine visual understanding. Prior work has weaponized these correlations as an attack vector to manipulate model predictions, such as inserting a deceiving class text onto the image in a "typographic" attack. These attacks succeed due to VLMs' text-heavy bias-a result of captions that echo visible words rather than describing content. However, this attack has focused solely on text that matches the target class exactly, overlooking a broader range of correlations, including non-matching text and graphical symbols, which arise from the abundance of branding content in web-scale data. To address this gap, we introduce "artifact-based" attacks: a novel class of manipulations that mislead models using both non-matching text and graphical elements. Unlike typographic attacks, these artifacts are not predefined, making them simultaneously harder to defend against and more challenging to find. We address this by framing artifact attacks as a search problem and demonstrate their effectiveness across five datasets, with some artifacts reinforcing each other to reach 100% attack success rates. These attacks transfer across models with up to 90% effectiveness, making it possible to attack unseen models. To defend against these attacks, we extend prior work's artifact aware prompting to the graphical setting. We see a moderate reduction of success rates of up to 15% relative to standard prompts, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing model robustness.

**Abstract**: The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses, has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1) jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage, supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines such as Llama Guard.

**Authors**: Yanxu Mao, Tiehan Cui, Peipei Liu, Datao You, Hongsong Zhu

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.



## **43. CyGATE: Game-Theoretic Cyber Attack-Defense Engine for Patch Strategy Optimization**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-08-01    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00478v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00478v1)

**Authors**: Yuning Jiang, Nay Oo, Qiaoran Meng, Lu Lin, Dusit Niyato, Zehui Xiong, Hoon Wei Lim, Biplab Sikdar

**Abstract**: Modern cyber attacks unfold through multiple stages, requiring defenders to dynamically prioritize mitigations under uncertainty. While game-theoretic models capture attacker-defender interactions, existing approaches often rely on static assumptions and lack integration with real-time threat intelligence, limiting their adaptability. This paper presents CyGATE, a game-theoretic framework modeling attacker-defender interactions, using large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance tactic selection and patch prioritization. Applied to a two-agent scenario, CyGATE frames cyber conflicts as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) across Cyber Kill Chain stages. Both agents use belief states to navigate uncertainty, with the attacker adapting tactics and the defender re-prioritizing patches based on evolving risks and observed adversary behavior. The framework's flexible architecture enables extension to multi-agent scenarios involving coordinated attackers, collaborative defenders, or complex enterprise environments with multiple stakeholders. Evaluated in a dynamic patch scheduling scenario, CyGATE effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability through dynamic threat integration, strategic foresight by anticipating attacker moves under uncertainty, and efficiency by optimizing resource use.

**Abstract**: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have the potential to revolutionize communications by supporting a range of applications, including urban parcel delivery, aerial inspections and air taxis. However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.

**Authors**: Ziqian Zhong, Aditi Raghunathan

**Abstract**: The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.   In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision.   For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation.   Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.



## **46. Graph Representation-based Model Poisoning on Federated Large Language Models**

**Authors**: Hanlin Cai, Haofan Dong, Houtianfu Wang, Kai Li, Ozgur B. Akan

**Abstract**: Federated large language models (FedLLMs) enable powerful generative capabilities within wireless networks while preserving data privacy. Nonetheless, FedLLMs remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.



## **47. Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-07-31    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06989v2)

**Authors**: Wenzhuo Xu, Zhipeng Wei, Xiongtao Sun, Zonghao Ying, Deyue Zhang, Dongdong Yang, Xiangzheng Zhang, Quanchen Zou

**Abstract**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.



## **48. Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents**

**Authors**: Aaron Xuxiang Tian, Ruofan Zhang, Janet Tang, Jiaxin Wen

**Abstract**: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2. Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate (e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates: Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains, with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.



## **49. CEE: An Inference-Time Jailbreak Defense for Embodied Intelligence via Subspace Concept Rotation**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-07-31    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13201v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13201v2)

**Authors**: Jirui Yang, Zheyu Lin, Zhihui Lu, Yinggui Wang, Lei Wang, Tao Wei, Xin Du, Shuhan Yang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming the cognitive core of Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. However, this integration also exposes them to serious jailbreak risks, where malicious instructions can be transformed into dangerous physical actions. Existing defense mechanisms suffer from notable drawbacks--including high training costs, significant inference delays, and complex hyperparameter tuning--which limit their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient inference-time defense framework: Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE). CEE enhances the model's inherent safety mechanisms by directly manipulating its internal representations, requiring neither additional training nor external modules, thereby improving defense efficiency. Furthermore, CEE introduces a rotation-based control mechanism that enables stable and linearly tunable behavioral control of the model. This design eliminates the need for tedious manual tuning and avoids the output degradation issues commonly observed in other representation engineering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple EI safety benchmarks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate that CEE significantly improves the defense success rates of various multimodal LLMs. It effectively mitigates safety risks while preserving high-quality generation and inference efficiency, offering a promising solution for deploying safer embodied intelligence systems.



## **50. Fine-Grained Privacy Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems via Knowledge Asymmetry Exploitation**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-07-31    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23229v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23229v1)

**Authors**: Yufei Chen, Yao Wang, Haibin Zhang, Tao Gu

**Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, but this advancement introduces significant privacy risks. Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger data leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived sentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across multiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel black-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and standard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous knowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that creates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content. Specifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information disparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and syntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature scores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike prior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative refinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we achieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in multi-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in case studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG systems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a foundation for adaptive mitigation.
