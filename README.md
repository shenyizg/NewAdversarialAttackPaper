**Abstract**: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06078v2)

**Authors**: Chihan Huang, Hao Tang

**Abstract**: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality, while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.



## **3. GSE: Group-wise Sparse and Explainable Adversarial Attacks**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17434v5) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17434v5)

**Authors**: Shpresim Sadiku, Moritz Wagner, Sebastian Pokutta

**Abstract**: Sparse adversarial attacks fool deep neural networks (DNNs) through minimal pixel perturbations, often regularized by the $\ell_0$ norm. Recent efforts have replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as the nuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. The resulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practical relevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs. However, crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computing norms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. We address this by presenting a two-phase algorithm that generates group-wise sparse attacks within semantically meaningful areas of an image. Initially, we optimize a quasinorm adversarial loss using the $1/2-$quasinorm proximal operator tailored for non-convex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to a projected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2-$norm regularization applied to perturbation magnitudes. Rigorous evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity, e.g., $50.9\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $38.4\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targeted attack). This performance improvement is accompanied by significantly faster computation times, improved explainability, and a $100\%$ attack success rate.



## **4. Unveiling Unicode's Unseen Underpinnings in Undermining Authorship Attribution**

cs.CR

33 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15840v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15840v3)

**Authors**: Robert Dilworth

**Abstract**: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence -- using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.



## **5. LatentBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models through Latent Space Feedback**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08604v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08604v2)

**Authors**: Raffaele Mura, Giorgio Piras, Kamilė Lukošiūtė, Maura Pintor, Amin Karbasi, Battista Biggio

**Abstract**: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak, a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.



## **6. UV-Attack: Physical-World Adversarial Attacks for Person Detection via Dynamic-NeRF-based UV Mapping**

cs.CV

23 pages, 22 figures, accepted by ICLR2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05783v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05783v2)

**Authors**: Yanjie Li, Kaisheng Liang, Bin Xiao

**Abstract**: In recent research, adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or static 3D model-based texture modifications have struggled with low success rates due to the flexible nature of human movement. Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.7% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.5% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the potential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification.

## **7. StyleGuard: Preventing Text-to-Image-Model-based Style Mimicry Attacks by Style Perturbations**

cs.CV

Accepted by NIPS2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18766v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18766v2)

**Authors**: Yanjie Li, Wenxuan Zhang, Xinqi Lyu, Yihao Liu, Bin Xiao

**Abstract**: Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses, showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show limited transferability across models, making them less effective against unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion. The code is available at https://github.com/PolyLiYJ/StyleGuard.



## **8. Robust Graph Condensation via Classification Complexity Mitigation**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26451v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26451v1)

**Authors**: Jiayi Luo, Qingyun Sun, Beining Yang, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Yanbiao Ma, Jianxin Li, Philip S. Yu

**Abstract**: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity. Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.



## **9. Two Heads are Better than One: Robust Learning Meets Multi-branch Models**

cs.CV

Camera-ready version for ICPADS 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08083v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08083v3)

**Authors**: Zongyuan Zhang, Qingwen Bu, Tianyang Duan, Zheng Lin, Yuhao Qing, Zihan Fang, Heming Cui, Dong Huang

**Abstract**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, in which DNNs are misled to false outputs due to inputs containing imperceptible perturbations. Adversarial training, a reliable and effective method of defense, may significantly reduce the vulnerability of neural networks and becomes the de facto standard for robust learning. While many recent works practice the data-centric philosophy, such as how to generate better adversarial examples or use generative models to produce additional training data, we look back to the models themselves and revisit the adversarial robustness from the perspective of deep feature distribution as an insightful complementarity. In this paper, we propose \textit{Branch Orthogonality adveRsarial Training} (BORT) to obtain state-of-the-art performance with solely the original dataset for adversarial training. To practice our design idea of integrating multiple orthogonal solution spaces, we leverage a simple and straightforward multi-branch neural network that eclipses adversarial attacks with no increase in inference time. We heuristically propose a corresponding loss function, branch-orthogonal loss, to make each solution space of the multi-branch model orthogonal. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN against $\ell_{\infty}$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\epsilon = 8/255$, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted to show that our method goes beyond all state-of-the-art methods without any tricks. Compared to all methods that do not use additional data for training, our models achieve 67.3\% and 41.5\% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (improving upon the state-of-the-art by +7.23\% and +9.07\%). We also outperform methods using a training set with a far larger scale than ours.



## **10. Multiple Proposer Transaction Fee Mechanism Design: Robust Incentives Against Censorship and Bribery**

cs.GT

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13751v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13751v2)

**Authors**: Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka, Julian Ma, Thomas Thiery

**Abstract**: Censorship resistance is one of the core value proposition of blockchains. A recurring design pattern aimed at providing censorship resistance is enabling multiple proposers to contribute inputs into block construction. Notably, Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) is proposed to be included in Ethereum. However, the current proposal relies on altruistic behavior, without a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM). This study aims to address this gap by exploring how multiple proposers should be rewarded to incentivize censorship resistance. The main contribution of this work is the identification of TFMs that ensure censorship resistance under bribery attacks, while also satisfying the incentive compatibility properties of EIP-1559. We provide a concrete payment mechanism for FOCIL, along with generalizable contributions to the literature by analyzing 1) incentive compatibility of TFMs in the presence of a bribing adversary, 2) TFMs in protocols with multiple phases of transaction inclusion, and 3) TFMs of protocols in which parties are uncertain about the behavior and the possible bribe of others.



## **11. PVMark: Enabling Public Verifiability for LLM Watermarking Schemes**

cs.CR

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26274v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26274v1)

**Authors**: Haohua Duan, Liyao Xiang, Xin Zhang

**Abstract**: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of `correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom, covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in practice.



## **12. Defending Multimodal Backdoored Models by Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20392v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20392v4)

**Authors**: Zhifang Zhang, Shuo He, Haobo Wang, Bingquan Shen, Lei Feng

**Abstract**: Multimodal contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) can learn high-quality representations from large-scale image-text datasets, while they exhibit significant vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks, raising serious safety concerns. In this paper, we reveal that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its tendency to encode features beyond in-dataset predictive patterns, compromising its visual feature resistivity to input perturbations. This makes its encoded features highly susceptible to being reshaped by backdoor triggers. To address this challenge, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs deep visual prompt tuning with a specially designed feature-repelling loss. Specifically, RVPT adversarially repels the encoded features from deeper layers while optimizing the standard cross-entropy loss, ensuring that only predictive features in downstream tasks are encoded, thereby enhancing CLIP's visual feature resistivity against input perturbations and mitigating its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters in CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods, reducing the attack success rate from 89.70\% to 2.76\% against the most advanced multimodal attacks on ImageNet and effectively generalizes its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.



## **13. Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26105v1)

**Authors**: Xiaosen Wang, Zhijin Ge, Shaokang Wang

**Abstract**: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks, especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content. Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of PReMA.



## **14. ALMGuard: Safety Shortcuts and Where to Find Them as Guardrails for Audio-Language Models**

cs.SD

Accepted to NeurIPS 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26096v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26096v1)

**Authors**: Weifei Jin, Yuxin Cao, Junjie Su, Minhui Xue, Jie Hao, Ke Xu, Jin Song Dong, Derui Wang

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard, the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM), which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new state of the art. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WeifeiJin/ALMGuard.



## **15. Chain-of-Scrutiny: Detecting Backdoor Attacks for Large Language Models**

cs.CR

This paper has been accepted to ACL Findings 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05948v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05948v4)

**Authors**: Xi Li, Ruofan Mao, Yusen Zhang, Renze Lou, Chen Wu, Jiaqi Wang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially those accessed via APIs, have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains. However, users without technical expertise often turn to (untrustworthy) third-party services, such as prompt engineering, to enhance their LLM experience, creating vulnerabilities to adversarial threats like backdoor attacks. Backdoor-compromised LLMs generate malicious outputs to users when inputs contain specific "triggers" set by attackers. Traditional defense strategies, originally designed for small-scale models, are impractical for API-accessible LLMs due to limited model access, high computational costs, and data requirements. To address these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Scrutiny (CoS) which leverages LLMs' unique reasoning abilities to mitigate backdoor attacks. It guides the LLM to generate reasoning steps for a given input and scrutinizes for consistency with the final output -- any inconsistencies indicating a potential attack. It is well-suited for the popular API-only LLM deployments, enabling detection at minimal cost and with little data. User-friendly and driven by natural language, it allows non-experts to perform the defense independently while maintaining transparency. We validate the effectiveness of CoS through extensive experiments on various tasks and LLMs, with results showing greater benefits for more powerful LLMs.



## **16. Boosting Generative Adversarial Transferability with Self-supervised Vision Transformer Features**

cs.CV

14 pages, 9 figures, accepted at ICCV 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21046v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21046v2)

**Authors**: Shangbo Wu, Yu-an Tan, Ruinan Ma, Wencong Ma, Dehua Zhu, Yuanzhang Li

**Abstract**: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs. Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts.

## **17. FGGM: Formal Grey-box Gradient Method for Attacking DRL-based MU-MIMO Scheduler**

cs.NI

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26075v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26075v1)

**Authors**: Thanh Le, Hai Duong, Yusheng Ji, ThanhVu Nguyen, John C. S. Lui

**Abstract**: In 5G mobile communication systems, MU-MIMO has been applied to enhance spectral efficiency and support high data rates. To maximize spectral efficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to selects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is NP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal solutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem. This paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit unsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing studies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact values of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink transmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an observation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to improve training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and lower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based solely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by leveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of a neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of intentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the whole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate that FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by adversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce the network throughput of a victim up to 70\% without knowing the exact value of victims' local observations. This study serves as a case study and can be applied to many other DRL-based problems, such as a knapsack-oriented resource allocation problems.



## **18. TextCrafter: Optimization-Calibrated Noise for Defending Against Text Embedding Inversion**

cs.CR

More sufficient and convincing experiments are needed

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17302v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17302v3)

**Authors**: Duoxun Tang, Xinhang Jiang, Jiajun Niu

**Abstract**: Text embedding inversion attacks reconstruct original sentences from latent representations, posing severe privacy threats in collaborative inference and edge computing. We propose TextCrafter, an optimization-based adversarial perturbation mechanism that combines RL learned, geometry aware noise injection orthogonal to user embeddings with cluster priors and PII signal guidance to suppress inversion while preserving task utility. Unlike prior defenses either non learnable or agnostic to perturbation direction, TextCrafter provides a directional protective policy that balances privacy and utility. Under strong privacy setting, TextCrafter maintains 70 percentage classification accuracy on four datasets and consistently outperforms Gaussian/LDP baselines across lower privacy budgets, demonstrating a superior privacy utility trade off.



## **19. Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization**

cs.CL

ICML 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03710v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03710v3)

**Authors**: Xuandong Zhao, Will Cai, Tianneng Shi, David Huang, Licong Lin, Song Mei, Dawn Song

**Abstract**: Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

## **20. SIRAJ: Diverse and Efficient Red-Teaming for LLM Agents via Distilled Structured Reasoning**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-10-30    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26037v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26037v1)

**Authors**: Kaiwen Zhou, Ahmed Elgohary, A S M Iftekhar, Amin Saied

**Abstract**: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings, our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1 model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer models.

**Authors**: Yize Cheng, Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Mehrdad Saberi, Shoumik Saha, Soheil Feizi

**Abstract**: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering. While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which, ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57% on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

**Authors**: Sajjad Maleki, E. Veronica Belmaga, Charalambos Konstantinou, Subhash Lakshminarayana

**Abstract**: The widespread integration of IoT-controllable devices (e.g., smart EV charging stations and heat pumps) into modern power systems enhances capabilities but introduces critical cybersecurity risks. Specifically, these devices are susceptible to load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can compromise power system safety. This paper quantifies the impact of LAAs on nodal voltage constraint violations in distribution networks (DNs). We first present closed-form expressions to analytically characterize LAA effects and quantify the minimum number of compromised devices for a successful LAA. Based on these insights, we propose a reactive defense mechanism that mitigates LAAs through DN reconfiguration. To address strategic adversaries, we then formulate defense strategies using a non-cooperative sequential game, which models the knowledgeable and strategic attacker, accounting for the worst-case scenario and enabling the reactive defender to devise an efficient and robust defense. Further, our formulation also accounts for uncertainties in attack localization. A novel Bayesian optimization approach is introduced to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium, significantly reducing computational burden efficiently. The game-theoretic strategy effectively mitigates the attack's impact while ensuring minimal system reconfiguration.

**Authors**: Jaechul Roh, Zachary Novack, Yuefeng Peng, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Amir Houmansadr

**Abstract**: Generative AI systems for music and video commonly use text-based filters to prevent the regurgitation of copyrighted material. We expose a fundamental flaw in this approach by introducing Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting phonetic memorization. The APT attack replaces iconic lyrics with homophonic but semantically unrelated alternatives (e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"), preserving acoustic structure while altering meaning; we identify high-fidelity phonetic matches using CMU pronouncing dictionary. We demonstrate that leading Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) models like SUNO and YuE regenerate songs with striking melodic and rhythmic similarity to their copyrighted originals when prompted with these altered lyrics. More surprisingly, this vulnerability extends across modalities. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from a song, a Text-to-Video (T2V) model like Veo 3 reconstructs visual scenes from the original music video-including specific settings and character archetypes-despite the absence of any visual cues in the prompt. Our findings reveal that models memorize deep, structural patterns tied to acoustics, not just verbatim text. This phonetic-to-visual leakage represents a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models, rendering simple copyright filters ineffective and raising urgent concerns about the secure deployment of multimodal AI systems. Demo examples are available at our project page (https://jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

**Authors**: Zheng Zhang, Guanlong Wu, Sen Deng, Shuai Wang, Yinqian Zhang

**Abstract**: In the rapidly expanding landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) applications, real-time output streaming has become the dominant interaction paradigm. While this enhances user experience, recent research reveals that it exposes a non-trivial attack surface through network side-channels. Adversaries can exploit patterns in encrypted traffic to infer sensitive information and reconstruct private conversations. In response, LLM providers and third-party services are deploying defenses such as traffic padding and obfuscation to mitigate these vulnerabilities.   This paper starts by presenting a systematic analysis of contemporary side-channel defenses in mainstream LLM applications, with a focus on services from vendors like OpenAI and DeepSeek. We identify and examine seven representative deployment scenarios, each incorporating active/passive mitigation techniques. Despite these enhanced security measures, our investigation uncovers significant residual information that remains vulnerable to leakage within the network traffic.   Building on this discovery, we introduce NetEcho, a novel, LLM-based framework that comprehensively unleashes the network side-channel risks of today's LLM applications. NetEcho is designed to recover entire conversations -- including both user prompts and LLM responses -- directly from encrypted network traffic. It features a deliberate design that ensures high-fidelity text recovery, transferability across different deployment scenarios, and moderate operational cost. In our evaluations on medical and legal applications built upon leading models like DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, NetEcho can recover avg $\sim$70\% information of each conversation, demonstrating a critical limitation in current defense mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and proposing future directions for augmenting network traffic security.

**Authors**: Junjie Hu, Sisi Duan

**Abstract**: Nakamoto consensus are the most widely adopted decentralized consensus mechanism in cryptocurrency systems. Since it was proposed in 2008, many studies have focused on analyzing its security. Most of them focus on maximizing the profit of the adversary. Examples include the selfish mining attack [FC '14] and the recent riskless uncle maker (RUM) attack [CCS '23]. In this work, we introduce the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM), the first block withholding attack targeting the timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchain. Through block withholding, timestamp manipulation, and difficulty risk control, SUUM adversaries are capable of launching persistent attacks with zero cost and minimal difficulty risk characteristics, indefinitely exploiting rewards from honest participants. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle that threatens the security of blockchains. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of SUUM, including the attack conditions, its impact on blockchains, and the difficulty risks. Finally, we further discuss four feasible mitigation measures against SUUM.

**Authors**: Yutong Zheng, Qingna Li

**Abstract**: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called $\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for adversarial learning of clustering models.

**Authors**: Xinyu Cao, Bimal Adhikari, Shangqing Zhao, Jingxian Wu, Yanjun Pan

**Abstract**: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence thresholds.



## **28. Jailbreak Transferability Emerges from Shared Representations**

**Authors**: Rico Angell, Jannik Brinkmann, He He

**Abstract**: Jailbreak transferability is the surprising phenomenon when an adversarial attack compromising one model also elicits harmful responses from other models. Despite widespread demonstrations, there is little consensus on why transfer is possible: is it a quirk of safety training, an artifact of model families, or a more fundamental property of representation learning? We present evidence that transferability emerges from shared representations rather than incidental flaws. Across 20 open-weight models and 33 jailbreak attacks, we find two factors that systematically shape transfer: (1) representational similarity under benign prompts, and (2) the strength of the jailbreak on the source model. To move beyond correlation, we show that deliberately increasing similarity through benign only distillation causally increases transfer. Our qualitative analyses reveal systematic transferability patterns across different types of jailbreaks. For example, persona-style jailbreaks transfer far more often than cipher-based prompts, consistent with the idea that natural-language attacks exploit models' shared representation space, whereas cipher-based attacks rely on idiosyncratic quirks that do not generalize. Together, these results reframe jailbreak transfer as a consequence of representation alignment rather than a fragile byproduct of safety training.

**Abstract**: Cybersecurity spans multiple interconnected domains, complicating the development of meaningful, labor-relevant benchmarks. Existing benchmarks assess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that pre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and defense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address this limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a modular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards meaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five evaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs, Attack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and privacy assessments. Key novel contributions include systematic simultaneous offensive-defensive evaluation, robotics-focused cybersecurity challenges (RCTF2), and privacy-preserving performance assessment (CyberPII-Bench). Evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals saturation on security knowledge metrics (~70\% success) but substantial degradation in multi-step adversarial (A\&D) scenarios (20-40\% success), or worse in robotic targets (22\% success). The combination of framework scaffolding and LLM model choice significantly impacts performance; we find that proper matches improve up to 2.6$\times$ variance in Attack and Defense CTFs. These results demonstrate a pronounced gap between conceptual knowledge and adaptive capability, emphasizing the need for a meta-benchmark.

**Authors**: Csaba Dékány, Stefan Balauca, Robin Staab, Dimitar I. Dimitrov, Martin Vechev

**Abstract**: Despite recent efforts in Large Language Model (LLM) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs can still consistently force harmful generations. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. At the same time, despite their effectiveness and generalization capabilities, training with continuous perturbations does not always capture the full spectrum of vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.

**Authors**: Neslihan Kose, Anthony Rhodes, Umur Aybars Ciftci, Ilke Demir

**Abstract**: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.

**Authors**: Ziqi Zhou, Yifan Hu, Yufei Song, Zijing Li, Shengshan Hu, Leo Yu Zhang, Dezhong Yao, Long Zheng, Hai Jin

**Abstract**: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

**Authors**: Xinzhe Huang, Wenjing Hu, Tianhang Zheng, Kedong Xiu, Xiaojun Jia, Di Wang, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren

**Abstract**: Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response. However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low attack efficiency.   To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UJA can achieve over 80% attack success rates against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and COLD-Attack by over 20%.

**Authors**: Ziyao Cui, Minxing Zhang, Jian Pei

**Abstract**: Privacy concerns have become increasingly critical in modern AI and data science applications, where sensitive information is collected, analyzed, and shared across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and mobility. While prior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many real-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing, where the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential disclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across releases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains hidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an attacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting dependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual release satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel attack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a Hidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional inference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and later observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate our framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary can recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive experiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model consistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release independently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to sequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can collectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally. These findings underscore the need for new privacy-preserving frameworks that explicitly model temporal dependencies, such as time-aware differential privacy or sequential data obfuscation strategies.

**Authors**: Xingyu Zhu, Beier Zhu, Shuo Wang, Kesen Zhao, Hanwang Zhang

**Abstract**: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.

**Authors**: Chuanghong Weng, Ehsan Nekouei

**Abstract**: In this paper, we first present a volumetric privacy measure for dynamical systems with bounded disturbances, wherein the states of the system contain private information and an adversary with access to sensor measurements attempts to infer the set of potential values of the private information. Under the proposed privacy measure, the volume of the uncertainty set of the adversary given the sensor measurements is considered as the privacy level of the system. We next characteristic the time evolution of the proposed privacy measure and study its properties for a particular system with both public and private states, where a set containing the public state is shared as the observation. Approximate set-membership estimation techniques are developed to compute the private-state uncertainty set, and the properties of the privacy measure are analyzed, demonstrating that the uncertainty reduction of the adversary is bounded by the information gain from the observation set. Furthermore, an optimization-based privacy filter design problem is formulated, employing randomization and linear programming to enhance the privacy level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a production-inventory case study. Results show that the optimal privacy filter significantly improves robustness against inference attacks and outperforms two baseline mechanisms based on additive noise and quantization.

**Authors**: Shane Dirksen, Radha Kumaran, You-Jin Kim, Yilin Wang, Tobias Höllerer

**Abstract**: We study attention in mobile Augmented Reality (AR) using object recall as a proxy outcome. We observe that the ability to recall an object (physical or virtual) that was encountered in a mobile AR experience depends on many possible impact factors and attributes, with some objects being readily recalled while others are not, and some people recalling objects overall much better or worse than others. This opens up a potential cognitive attack in which adversaries might create conditions that make an AR user not recall certain potentially mission-critical objects. We explore whether a calibrated predictor of object recall can help shield against such cognitive attacks. We pool data from four mobile AR studies (with a total of 1,152 object recall probes) and fit a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) with formative Object, Scene, and User State composites predicting recall, also benchmarking against Random Forest and multilayer perceptron classifiers. PLS-SEM attains the best F1 score in three of four studies. Additionally, path estimates identify lighting, augmentation density, AR registration stability, cognitive load, and AR familiarity as primary drivers. The model outputs per-object recall probabilities that can drive interface adjustments when predicted recall falls. Overall, PLS-SEM provides competitive accuracy with interpretable levers for design and evaluation in mobile AR.

**Authors**: Vladyslav Larin, Ihor Naumenko, Aleksei Ivashov, Ivan Nikitin, Alexander Firsov

**Abstract**: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of +17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness. Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or security.

**Abstract**: Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles (CAEV) is the solution to the future smart mobility having benefits of efficient traffic flow and cleaner environmental impact. Although CAEV has advantages they are still susceptible to adversarial cyber attacks due to their autonomous electric operation and the involved connectivity. To alleviate this issue, we propose a secure control architecture of CAEV. Particularly, we design an additional control input using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to be applied to the vehicle powertrain along with the input commanded by the battery. We present simulation case studies to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in keeping the CAEV platoon operating safely without collisions by curbing the effect of adversarial attacks.

**Abstract**: The growing body of literature on training-data reconstruction attacks raises significant concerns about deploying neural network classifiers trained on sensitive data. However, differentially private (DP) training (e.g. using DP-SGD) can defend against such attacks with large training datasets causing only minimal loss of network utility. Folklore, heuristics, and (albeit pessimistic) DP bounds suggest this fails for networks trained with small per-class datasets, yet to the best of our knowledge the literature offers no compelling evidence. We directly demonstrate this vulnerability by significantly extending reconstruction attack capabilities under a realistic adversary threat model for few-shot transfer learned image classifiers. We design new white-box and black-box attacks and find that DP-SGD is unable to defend against these without significant classifier utility loss. To address this, we propose a novel homomorphic encryption (HE) method that protects training data without degrading model's accuracy. Conventional HE secures model's input data and requires costly homomorphic implementation of the entire classifier. In contrast, our new scheme is computationally efficient and protects training data rather than input data. This is achieved by means of a simple role-reversal where classifier input data is unencrypted but transfer-learned weights are encrypted. Classifier outputs remain encrypted, thus preventing both white-box and black-box (and any other) training-data reconstruction attacks. Under this new scheme only a trusted party with a private decryption key can obtain the classifier class decisions.

**Authors**: Liou Tang, James Joshi, Ashish Kundu

**Abstract**: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to update Machine Learning (ML) models following requests to remove training samples and their influences on a trained model efficiently without retraining the original ML model from scratch. While MU itself has been employed to provide privacy protection and regulatory compliance, it can also increase the attack surface of the model. Existing privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model only. We demonstrate that our proposed attack, while requiring less access to the target model compared to previous attacks, can achieve relatively high precision on the membership status of the unlearned samples.

**Authors**: Mansi Phute, Matthew Hull, Haoran Wang, Alec Helbling, ShengYun Peng, Willian Lunardi, Martin Andreoni, Wenke Lee, Duen Horng Chau

**Abstract**: Deep learning models deployed in safety critical applications like autonomous driving use simulations to test their robustness against adversarial attacks in realistic conditions. However, these simulations are non-differentiable, forcing researchers to create attacks that do not integrate simulation environmental factors, reducing attack success. To address this limitation, we introduce UNDREAM, the first software framework that bridges the gap between photorealistic simulators and differentiable renderers to enable end-to-end optimization of adversarial perturbations on any 3D objects. UNDREAM enables manipulation of the environment by offering complete control over weather, lighting, backgrounds, camera angles, trajectories, and realistic human and object movements, thereby allowing the creation of diverse scenes. We showcase a wide array of distinct physically plausible adversarial objects that UNDREAM enables researchers to swiftly explore in different configurable environments. This combination of photorealistic simulation and differentiable optimization opens new avenues for advancing research of physical adversarial attacks.

**Authors**: Ning Zhang, Henry Kenlay, Li Zhang, Mihai Cucuringu, Xiaowen Dong

**Abstract**: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.

**Authors**: Saleh Darzi, Mirza Masfiqur Rahman, Imtiaz Karim, Rouzbeh Behnia, Attila A Yavuz, Elisa Bertino

**Abstract**: The 5G protocol lacks a robust base station authentication mechanism during the initial bootstrapping phase, leaving it susceptible to threats such as fake base station attacks. Conventional solutions, including digital signatures based on Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) and identity-based signatures, are inadequate against quantum-capable adversaries. While integrating NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards is a leading approach for quantum resistance, their suitability for 5G base station authentication remains unexplored. Moreover, current solutions are predominantly centralized and lack security features such as distributed authentication. This work presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive network-level performance characterization of integrating NIST-PQC standards and conventional digital signatures (including threshold and identity-based schemes) into 5G base station authentication. Our findings reveal significant feasibility concerns, with direct PQC adoption hindered by protocol constraints and large signature sizes. We also highlight the performance limitations of conventional methods due to the overhead of certificate chains. To mitigate these challenges, we propose BORG, a transitional authentication solution based on a Hierarchical Identity-Based Threshold Signature scheme with a Fail-Stop property. BORG offers post-mortem post-quantum forgery detection and distributed trust via threshold and compact signatures, well-suited for 5G's stringent requirements. Our performance analysis underscores an important warning on the infeasibility of direct PQC integration and positions BORG as an effective transitional solution toward future quantum-resilient 5G authentication.

**Authors**: Ngoc N. Tran, Lam Tran, Hoang Phan, Anh Bui, Tung Pham, Toan Tran, Dinh Phung, Trung Le

**Abstract**: Contrastive Learning first extracts features from unlabeled data, followed by linear probing with labeled data. Adversarial Contrastive Learning (ACL) integrates Adversarial Training into the first phase to enhance feature robustness against attacks in the probing phase. While ACL has shown strong empirical results, its theoretical understanding remains limited. Furthermore, while a fair amount of theoretical works analyze how the unsupervised loss can support the supervised loss in the probing phase, none has examined its role to the robust supervised loss. To fill this gap, our work develops rigorous theories to identify which components in the unsupervised training can help improve the robust supervised loss. Specifically, besides the adversarial contrastive loss, we reveal that the benign one, along with a global divergence between benign and adversarial examples can also improve robustness. Proper experiments are conducted to justify our findings.

**Authors**: Xiaosen Wang, Shaokang Wang, Zhijin Ge, Yuyang Luo, Shudong Zhang

**Abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-AI-Group/VMA.

**Authors**: Jin Hu, Jiakai Wang, Linna Jing, Haolin Li, Haodong Liu, Haotong Qin, Aishan Liu, Ke Xu, Xianglong Liu

**Abstract**: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues, this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction (InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable, adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method, we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler, therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation, we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial examples for the first time.

**Authors**: Wesley Hanwen Deng, Sunnie S. Y. Kim, Akshita Jha, Ken Holstein, Motahhare Eslami, Lauren Wilcox, Leon A Gatys

**Abstract**: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming, that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods, shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between automated and human red-teaming approaches.



## **49. CompressionAttack: Exploiting Prompt Compression as a New Attack Surface in LLM-Powered Agents**

**Authors**: Zesen Liu, Zhixiang Zhang, Yuchong Xie, Dongdong She

**Abstract**: LLM-powered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs, but this introduces a new security risk. Compression modules, which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety, can be manipulated by adversarial inputs, causing semantic drift and altering LLM behavior. This work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents CompressionAttack, the first framework to exploit it. CompressionAttack includes two strategies: HardCom, which uses discrete adversarial edits for hard compression, and SoftCom, which performs latent-space perturbations for soft compression. Experiments on multiple LLMs show up to 80% attack success and 98% preference flips, while remaining highly stealthy and transferable. Case studies in VSCode Cline and Ollama confirm real-world impact, and current defenses prove ineffective, highlighting the need for stronger protections.

**Authors**: Simin Chen, Jinjun Peng, Yixin He, Junfeng Yang, Baishakhi Ray

**Abstract**: Deep learning (DL) compilers are core infrastructure in modern DL systems, offering flexibility and scalability beyond vendor-specific libraries. This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+ downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation.   Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently alter model semantics. To our knowledge, this is the first work to expose inherent security risks in DL compiler design, opening a new direction for secure and trustworthy ML.
