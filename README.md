**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04036v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04036v1)

**Authors**: Wei Wenying, Zhao Kaifa, Xue Lei, Fan Ming

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful information handling capabilities and are widely integrated into chatbot applications. OpenAI provides a platform for developers to construct custom GPTs, extending ChatGPT's functions and integrating external services. Since its release in November 2023, over 3 million custom GPTs have been created. However, such a vast ecosystem also conceals security and privacy threats. For developers, instruction leaking attacks threaten the intellectual property of instructions in custom GPTs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. For users, unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs or integrated third-party services raises significant privacy concerns. To systematically evaluate the scope of threats in real-world LLM applications, we develop three phases instruction leaking attacks target GPTs with different defense level. Our widespread experiments on 10,000 real-world custom GPTs reveal that over 98.8% of GPTs are vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks via one or more adversarial prompts, and half of the remaining GPTs can also be attacked through multiround conversations. We also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of defensive strategies and identify unwanted behaviors in custom GPTs. Our findings show that 77.5% of custom GPTs with defense strategies are vulnerable to basic instruction leaking attacks. Additionally, we reveal that 738 custom GPTs collect user conversational information, and identified 8 GPTs exhibiting data access behaviors that are unnecessary for their intended functionalities. Our findings raise awareness among GPT developers about the importance of integrating specific defensive strategies in their instructions and highlight users' concerns about data privacy when using LLM-based applications.

**Abstract**: AI-generated images have reached a quality level at which humans are incapable of reliably distinguishing them from real images. To counteract the inherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images is a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the presented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually evaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness is often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial effort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work, we tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of AI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of AI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable adversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an ensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four different text-to-image models. Extensive experiments show that our methodology generates adversarial images that transfer with a high success rate to unseen detectors, which can be used to quickly provide an approximate yet still reliable estimate of a detector's adversarial robustnessOur findings indicate that current state-of-the-art AI-generated image detectors can be easily deceived by adversarial examples, highlighting the critical need for the development of more robust methods. We release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/aimagelab/RAID and evaluation code at https://github.com/pralab/RAID.

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03933v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03933v1)

**Authors**: Jia Fu, Yongtao Wu, Yihang Chen, Kunyu Peng, Xiao Zhang, Volkan Cevher, Sepideh Pashami, Anders Holst

**Abstract**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time, thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.



## **4. Prediction Inconsistency Helps Achieve Generalizable Detection of Adversarial Examples**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03765v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03765v1)

**Authors**: Sicong Han, Chenhao Lin, Zhengyu Zhao, Xiyuan Wang, Xinlei He, Qian Li, Cong Wang, Qian Wang, Chao Shen

**Abstract**: Adversarial detection protects models from adversarial attacks by refusing suspicious test samples. However, current detection methods often suffer from weak generalization: their effectiveness tends to degrade significantly when applied to adversarially trained models rather than naturally trained ones, and they generally struggle to achieve consistent effectiveness across both white-box and black-box attack settings. In this work, we observe that an auxiliary model, differing from the primary model in training strategy or model architecture, tends to assign low confidence to the primary model's predictions on adversarial examples (AEs), while preserving high confidence on normal examples (NEs). Based on this discovery, we propose Prediction Inconsistency Detector (PID), a lightweight and generalizable detection framework to distinguish AEs from NEs by capturing the prediction inconsistency between the primal and auxiliary models. PID is compatible with both naturally and adversarially trained primal models and outperforms four detection methods across 3 white-box, 3 black-box, and 1 mixed adversarial attacks. Specifically, PID achieves average AUC scores of 99.29\% and 99.30\% on CIFAR-10 when the primal model is naturally and adversarially trained, respectively, and 98.31% and 96.81% on ImageNet under the same conditions, outperforming existing SOTAs by 4.70%$\sim$25.46%.



## **5. PRJ: Perception-Retrieval-Judgement for Generated Images**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03683v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03683v1)

**Authors**: Qiang Fu, Zonglei Jing, Zonghao Ying, Xiaoqian Li

**Abstract**: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled remarkable creative capabilities, yet it also raises urgent concerns regarding the safety of AI-generated visual content in real-world applications such as content moderation, platform governance, and digital media regulation. This includes unsafe material such as sexually explicit images, violent scenes, hate symbols, propaganda, and unauthorized imitations of copyrighted artworks. Existing image safety systems often rely on rigid category filters and produce binary outputs, lacking the capacity to interpret context or reason about nuanced, adversarially induced forms of harm. In addition, standard evaluation metrics (e.g., attack success rate) fail to capture the semantic severity and dynamic progression of toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose Perception-Retrieval-Judgement (PRJ), a cognitively inspired framework that models toxicity detection as a structured reasoning process. PRJ follows a three-stage design: it first transforms an image into descriptive language (perception), then retrieves external knowledge related to harm categories and traits (retrieval), and finally evaluates toxicity based on legal or normative rules (judgement). This language-centric structure enables the system to detect both explicit and implicit harms with improved interpretability and categorical granularity. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scoring mechanism based on a contextual toxicity risk matrix to quantify harmfulness across different semantic dimensions. Experiments show that PRJ surpasses existing safety checkers in detection accuracy and robustness while uniquely supporting structured category-level toxicity interpretation.



## **6. VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03614v1)

**Authors**: Zhanhui Zhou, Lingjie Chen, Chao Yang, Chaochao Lu

**Abstract**: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at https://github.com/ZHZisZZ/visual-stitching.



## **7. Across Programming Language Silos: A Study on Cross-Lingual Retrieval-augmented Code Generation**

cs.SE

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-04    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03535v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03535v1)

**Authors**: Qiming Zhu, Jialun Cao, Xuanang Chen, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Shing-Chi Cheung

**Abstract**: Current research on large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) mainly focuses on single-language settings, leaving cross-lingual effectiveness and security unexplored. Multi-lingual RACG systems are valuable for migrating code-bases across programming languages (PLs), yet face risks from error (e.g. adversarial data corruption) propagation in cross-lingual transfer. We construct a dataset spanning 13 PLs with nearly 14k instances to explore utility and robustness of multi-lingual RACG systems. Our investigation reveals four key insights: (1) Effectiveness: multi-lingual RACG significantly enhances multi-lingual code LLMs generation; (2) Inequality: Java demonstrate superior cross-lingual utility over Python in RACG; (3) Robustness: Adversarial attacks degrade performance significantly in mono-lingual RACG but show mitigated impacts in cross-lingual scenarios; Counterintuitively, perturbed code may improve RACG in cross-lingual scenarios; (4) Specialization: Domain-specific code retrievers outperform significantly general text retrievers. These findings establish foundation for developing effective and secure multi-lingual code assistants.



## **8. Secure and Private Federated Learning: Achieving Adversarial Resilience through Robust Aggregation**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17226v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17226v2)

**Authors**: Kun Yang, Neena Imam

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. It offers a promising approach to privacy-preserving AI. However, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial threats from malicious participants, referred to as Byzantine clients, who can send misleading updates to corrupt the global model. Traditional aggregation methods, such as simple averaging, are not robust to such attacks. More resilient approaches, like the Krum algorithm, require prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Average-rKrum (ArKrum), a novel aggregation strategy designed to enhance both the resilience and privacy guarantees of FL systems. Building on our previous work (rKrum), ArKrum introduces two key innovations. First, it includes a median-based filtering mechanism that removes extreme outliers before estimating the number of adversarial clients. Second, it applies a multi-update averaging scheme to improve stability and performance, particularly when client data distributions are not identical. We evaluate ArKrum on benchmark image and text datasets under three widely studied Byzantine attack types. Results show that ArKrum consistently achieves high accuracy and stability. It performs as well as or better than other robust aggregation methods. These findings demonstrate that ArKrum is an effective and practical solution for secure FL systems in adversarial environments.



## **9. Addressing Key Challenges of Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in the Tabular Domain: A Methodological Framework for Coherence and Consistency**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07326v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07326v2)

**Authors**: Yael Itzhakev, Amit Giloni, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai

**Abstract**: Machine learning models trained on tabular data are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, even in realistic scenarios where attackers only have access to the model's outputs. Since tabular data contains complex interdependencies among features, it presents a unique challenge for adversarial samples which must maintain coherence and respect these interdependencies to remain indistinguishable from benign data. Moreover, existing attack evaluation metrics-such as the success rate, perturbation magnitude, and query count-fail to account for this challenge. To address those gaps, we propose a technique for perturbing dependent features while preserving sample coherence. In addition, we introduce Class-Specific Anomaly Detection (CSAD), an effective novel anomaly detection approach, along with concrete metrics for assessing the quality of tabular adversarial attacks. CSAD evaluates adversarial samples relative to their predicted class distribution, rather than a broad benign distribution. It ensures that subtle adversarial perturbations, which may appear coherent in other classes, are correctly identified as anomalies. We integrate SHAP explainability techniques to detect inconsistencies in model decision-making, extending CSAD for SHAP-based anomaly detection. Our evaluation incorporates both anomaly detection rates with SHAP-based assessments to provide a more comprehensive measure of adversarial sample quality. We evaluate various attack strategies, examining black-box query-based and transferability-based gradient attacks across four target models. Experiments on benchmark tabular datasets reveal key differences in the attacker's risk and effort and attack quality, offering insights into the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs faced by attackers and defenders. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on adversarial attacks and defense development in the tabular domain.



## **10. Robustness in Both Domains: CLIP Needs a Robust Text Encoder**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03355v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03355v1)

**Authors**: Elias Abad Rocamora, Christian Schlarmann, Naman Deep Singh, Yongtao Wu, Matthias Hein, Volkan Cevher

**Abstract**: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization.



## **11. Adversarial Attacks on Robotic Vision Language Action Models**

cs.RO

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03350v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03350v1)

**Authors**: Eliot Krzysztof Jones, Alexander Robey, Andy Zou, Zachary Ravichandran, George J. Pappas, Hamed Hassani, Matt Fredrikson, J. Zico Kolter

**Abstract**: The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse, and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm. We make all code available at https://github.com/eliotjones1/robogcg .



## **12. Mind the Gap: A Practical Attack on GGUF Quantization**

cs.CR

ICML 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23786v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23786v3)

**Authors**: Kazuki Egashira, Robin Staab, Mark Vero, Jingxuan He, Martin Vechev

**Abstract**: With the increasing size of frontier LLMs, post-training quantization has become the standard for memory-efficient deployment. Recent work has shown that basic rounding-based quantization schemes pose security risks, as they can be exploited to inject malicious behaviors into quantized models that remain hidden in full precision. However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more complex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular ollama and llama$.$cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization error -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their (de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct malicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging this, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while constraining its weights based on quantization errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on three popular LLMs across nine GGUF quantization data types on three diverse attack scenarios: insecure code generation ($\Delta$=$88.7\%$), targeted content injection ($\Delta$=$85.0\%$), and benign instruction refusal ($\Delta$=$30.1\%$). Our attack highlights that (1) the most widely used post-training quantization method is susceptible to adversarial interferences, and (2) the complexity of quantization schemes alone is insufficient as a defense.



## **13. On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01213v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01213v2)

**Authors**: Ning Zhang, Henry Kenlay, Li Zhang, Mihai Cucuringu, Xiaowen Dong

**Abstract**: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.



## **14. Agnostic Learning under Targeted Poisoning: Optimal Rates and the Role of Randomness**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03075v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03075v1)

**Authors**: Bogdan Chornomaz, Yonatan Koren, Shay Moran, Tom Waknine

**Abstract**: We study the problem of learning in the presence of an adversary that can corrupt an $\eta$ fraction of the training examples with the goal of causing failure on a specific test point. In the realizable setting, prior work established that the optimal error under such instance-targeted poisoning attacks scales as $\Theta(d\eta)$, where $d$ is the VC dimension of the hypothesis class arXiv:2210.02713. In this work, we resolve the corresponding question in the agnostic setting. We show that the optimal excess error is $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\eta})$, answering one of the main open problems left by Hanneke et al. To achieve this rate, it is necessary to use randomized learners: Hanneke et al. showed that deterministic learners can be forced to suffer error close to 1, even under small amounts of poisoning. Perhaps surprisingly, our upper bound remains valid even when the learner's random bits are fully visible to the adversary . In the other direction, our lower bound is stronger than standard PAC-style bounds: instead of tailoring a hard distribution separately for each sample size, we exhibit a single fixed distribution under which the adversary can enforce an excess error of $\Omega(\sqrt{d\eta})$ infinitely often.



## **15. Adversarial Robustness of AI-Generated Image Detectors in the Real World**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01574v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01574v3)

**Authors**: Sina Mavali, Jonas Ricker, David Pape, Asja Fischer, Lea Schönherr

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) capabilities is accompanied by a concerning rise in its misuse. In particular the generation of credible misinformation in the form of images poses a significant threat to the public trust in democratic processes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop tools to reliably distinguish between authentic and AI-generated content. The majority of detection methods are based on neural networks that are trained to recognize forensic artifacts. In this work, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples under real-world conditions. Through extensive experiments, comprising four detection methods and five attack algorithms, we show that an attacker can dramatically decrease classification performance, without internal knowledge of the detector's architecture. Notably, most attacks remain effective even when images are degraded during the upload to, e.g., social media platforms. In a case study, we demonstrate that these robustness challenges are also found in commercial tools by conducting black-box attacks on HIVE, a proprietary online GenAI media detector. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of using generated features of a robust pre-trained model and showed that this increases the robustness, while not reaching the performance on benign inputs. These results, along with the increasing potential of GenAI to erode public trust, underscore the need for more research and new perspectives on methods to prevent its misuse.



## **16. BadReward: Clean-Label Poisoning of Reward Models in Text-to-Image RLHF**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03234v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03234v1)

**Authors**: Kaiwen Duan, Hongwei Yao, Yufei Chen, Ziyun Li, Tong Qiao, Zhan Qin, Cong Wang

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. However, RLHF's feedback mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer.

## **17. On the Robustness of Tabular Foundation Models: Test-Time Attacks and In-Context Defenses**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02978v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02978v1)

**Authors**: Mohamed Djilani, Thibault Simonetto, Karim Tit, Florian Tambon, Paul Récamier, Salah Ghamizi, Maxime Cordy, Mike Papadakis

**Abstract**: Recent tabular Foundational Models (FM) such as TabPFN and TabICL, leverage in-context learning to achieve strong performance without gradient updates or fine-tuning. However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small, structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation practices in this emerging paradigm.



## **18. Average Certified Radius is a Poor Metric for Randomized Smoothing**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06895v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06895v3)

**Authors**: Chenhao Sun, Yuhao Mao, Mark Niklas Müller, Martin Vechev

**Abstract**: Randomized smoothing (RS) is popular for providing certified robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks. The average certified radius (ACR) has emerged as a widely used metric for tracking progress in RS. However, in this work, for the first time we show that ACR is a poor metric for evaluating robustness guarantees provided by RS. We theoretically prove not only that a trivial classifier can have arbitrarily large ACR, but also that ACR is extremely sensitive to improvements on easy samples. In addition, the comparison using ACR has a strong dependence on the certification budget. Empirically, we confirm that existing training strategies, though improving ACR, reduce the model's robustness on hard samples consistently. To strengthen our findings, we propose strategies, including explicitly discarding hard samples, reweighing the dataset with approximate certified radius, and extreme optimization for easy samples, to replicate the progress in RS training and even achieve the state-of-the-art ACR on CIFAR-10, without training for robustness on the full data distribution. Overall, our results suggest that ACR has introduced a strong undesired bias to the field, and its application should be discontinued in RS. Finally, we suggest using the empirical distribution of $p_A$, the accuracy of the base model on noisy data, as an alternative metric for RS.



## **19. PoisonArena: Uncovering Competing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

Project page: https://poison-arena.github.io/

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12574v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12574v4)

**Authors**: Liuji Chen, Xiaofang Yang, Yuanzhuo Lu, Jinghao Zhang, Xin Sun, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Jing Dong, Liang Wang

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, widely used to improve the factual grounding of large language models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject manipulated content into the retriever's corpus. While prior research has predominantly focused on single-attacker settings, real-world scenarios often involve multiple, competing attackers with conflicting objectives. In this work, we introduce PoisonArena, the first benchmark to systematically study and evaluate competing poisoning attacks in RAG. We formalize the multi-attacker threat model, where attackers vie to control the answer to the same query using mutually exclusive misinformation. PoisonArena leverages the Bradley-Terry model to quantify each method's competitive effectiveness in such adversarial environments. Through extensive experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, we demonstrate that many attack strategies successful in isolation fail under competitive pressure. Our findings highlight the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) and F1 score and underscore the need for competitive evaluation to assess real-world attack robustness. PoisonArena provides a standardized framework to benchmark and develop future attack and defense strategies under more realistic, multi-adversary conditions.



## **20. Privacy Leaks by Adversaries: Adversarial Iterations for Membership Inference Attack**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-06-03    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02711v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02711v1)

**Authors**: Jing Xue, Zhishen Sun, Haishan Ye, Luo Luo, Xiangyu Chang, Ivor Tsang, Guang Dai

**Abstract**: Membership inference attack (MIA) has become one of the most widely used and effective methods for evaluating the privacy risks of machine learning models. These attacks aim to determine whether a specific sample is part of the model's training set by analyzing the model's output. While traditional membership inference attacks focus on leveraging the model's posterior output, such as confidence on the target sample, we propose IMIA, a novel attack strategy that utilizes the process of generating adversarial samples to infer membership. We propose to infer the member properties of the target sample using the number of iterations required to generate its adversarial sample. We conduct experiments across multiple models and datasets, and our results demonstrate that the number of iterations for generating an adversarial sample is a reliable feature for membership inference, achieving strong performance both in black-box and white-box attack scenarios. This work provides a new perspective for evaluating model privacy and highlights the potential of adversarial example-based features for privacy leakage assessment.

**Authors**: Huanran Chen, Yinpeng Dong, Zeming Wei, Hang Su, Jun Zhu

**Abstract**: Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.

**Abstract**: A significant body of research in decentralized federated learning focuses on combining the privacy-preserving properties of federated learning with the resilience and transparency offered by blockchain-based systems. While these approaches are promising, they often lack flexible tools to evaluate system robustness under adversarial conditions. To fill this gap, we present FedBlockParadox, a modular framework for modeling and evaluating decentralized federated learning systems built on blockchain technologies, with a focus on resilience against a broad spectrum of adversarial attack scenarios. It supports multiple consensus protocols, validation methods, aggregation strategies, and configurable attack models. By enabling controlled experiments, FedBlockParadox provides a valuable resource for researchers developing secure, decentralized learning solutions. The framework is open-source and built to be extensible by the community.

**Authors**: Gabriele Digregorio, Salvatore Maccarrone, Mario D'Onghia, Luigi Gallo, Michele Carminati, Mario Polino, Stefano Zanero

**Abstract**: Machine learning algorithms can effectively classify malware through dynamic behavior but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing attacks, however, often fail to find an effective solution in both the feature and problem spaces. This issue arises from not addressing the intrinsic nondeterministic nature of malware, namely executing the same sample multiple times may yield significantly different behaviors. Hence, the perturbations computed for a specific behavior may be ineffective for others observed in subsequent executions. In this paper, we show how an attacker can augment their chance of success by leveraging a new and more efficient feature space algorithm for sequential data, which we have named PS-FGSM, and by adopting two problem space strategies specially tailored to address nondeterminism in the problem space. We implement our novel algorithm and attack strategies in Tarallo, an end-to-end adversarial framework that significantly outperforms previous works in both white and black-box scenarios. Our preliminary analysis in a sandboxed environment and against two RNN-based malware detectors, shows that Tarallo achieves a success rate up to 99% on both feature and problem space attacks while significantly minimizing the number of modifications required for misclassification.

**Authors**: Kalyan Nakka, Nitesh Saxena

**Abstract**: The inherent risk of generating harmful and unsafe content by Large Language Models (LLMs), has highlighted the need for their safety alignment. Various techniques like supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red-teaming were developed for ensuring the safety alignment of LLMs. However, the robustness of these aligned LLMs is always challenged by adversarial attacks that exploit unexplored and underlying vulnerabilities of the safety alignment. In this paper, we develop a novel black-box jailbreak attack, called BitBypass, that leverages hyphen-separated bitstream camouflage for jailbreaking aligned LLMs. This represents a new direction in jailbreaking by exploiting fundamental information representation of data as continuous bits, rather than leveraging prompt engineering or adversarial manipulations. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral, in adversarial perspective, revealed the capabilities of BitBypass in bypassing their safety alignment and tricking them into generating harmful and unsafe content. Further, we observed that BitBypass outperforms several state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks in terms of stealthiness and attack success. Overall, these results highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of BitBypass in jailbreaking these state-of-the-art LLMs.

**Authors**: Yasutoshi Nagahama, Kosuke Miyazato, Kazuhiro Takemoto

**Abstract**: This study investigates adversarial attacks, a concept from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted minimal perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an adversarial optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.

**Authors**: Jiawei Lian, Jianhong Pan, Lefan Wang, Yi Wang, Shaohui Mei, Lap-Pui Chau

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

**Authors**: Yash Saxena, Ankur Padia, Mandar S Chaudhary, Kalpa Gunaratna, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Manas Gaur

**Abstract**: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

**Authors**: Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo, Moinul Hossain

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted as a decentralized machine learning paradigm due to its capability to preserve data privacy by training models without centralizing user data. However, FL is susceptible to indirect privacy breaches via network traffic analysis-an area not explored in existing research. The primary objective of this research is to study the feasibility of fingerprinting deep learning models deployed within FL environments by analyzing their network-layer traffic information. In this paper, we conduct an experimental evaluation using various deep learning architectures (i.e., CNN, RNN) within a federated learning testbed. We utilize machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient-Boosting, to fingerprint unique patterns within the traffic data. Our experiments show high fingerprinting accuracy, achieving 100% accuracy using Random Forest and around 95.7% accuracy using SVM and Gradient Boosting classifiers. This analysis suggests that we can identify specific architectures running within the subsection of the network traffic. Hence, if an adversary knows about the underlying DL architecture, they can exploit that information and conduct targeted attacks. These findings suggest a notable security vulnerability in FL systems and the necessity of strengthening it at the network level.

**Authors**: Anselm Paulus, Arman Zharmagambetov, Chuan Guo, Brandon Amos, Yuandong Tian

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires a time-consuming search for adversarial prompts, whereas automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that do not scale well. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds. AdvPrompter, which is trained using an alternating optimization algorithm, generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show highly competitive results on the AdvBench and HarmBench datasets, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLMs. We also show that training on adversarial suffixes generated by AdvPrompter is a promising strategy for improving the robustness of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks.

**Authors**: Ethan Rathbun, Alina Oprea, Christopher Amato

**Abstract**: Recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms against training-time, backdoor poisoning attacks. The objectives of these attacks are twofold: induce pre-determined, adversarial behavior in the agent upon observing a fixed trigger during deployment while allowing the agent to solve its intended task during training. Prior attacks assume arbitrary control over the agent's rewards, inducing values far outside the environment's natural constraints. This results in brittle attacks that fail once the proper reward constraints are enforced. Thus, in this work we propose a new class of backdoor attacks against DRL which are the first to achieve state of the art performance under strict reward constraints. These "inception" attacks manipulate the agent's training data -- inserting the trigger into prior observations and replacing high return actions with those of the targeted adversarial behavior. We formally define these attacks and prove they achieve both adversarial objectives against arbitrary Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Using this framework we devise an online inception attack which achieves an 100\% attack success rate on multiple environments under constrained rewards while minimally impacting the agent's task performance.

**Authors**: Xiaolin Li, Ninghui Li, Boyang Wang, Wenhai Sun

**Abstract**: The distributed nature of local differential privacy (LDP) invites data poisoning attacks and poses unforeseen threats to the underlying LDP-supported applications. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive mitigation framework for popular frequency estimation, which contains a suite of novel defenses, including malicious user detection, attack pattern recognition, and damaged utility recovery. In addition to existing attacks, we explore new adaptive adversarial activities for our mitigation design. For detection, we present a new method to precisely identify bogus reports and thus LDP aggregation can be performed over the ``clean'' data. When the attack behavior becomes stealthy and direct filtering out malicious users is difficult, we further propose a detection that can effectively recognize hidden adversarial patterns, thus facilitating the decision-making of service providers. These detection methods require no additional data and attack information and incur minimal computational cost. Our experiment demonstrates their excellent performance and substantial improvement over previous work in various settings. In addition, we conduct an empirical analysis of LDP post-processing for corrupted data recovery and propose a new post-processing method, through which we reveal new insights into protocol recommendations in practice and key design principles for future research.

**Authors**: Rishi Raj Sahoo, Rucha Bhalchandra Joshi, Subhankar Mishra

**Abstract**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance across many applications but function as black-box models, limiting their use in critical domains like healthcare and criminal justice. Explainability methods address this by providing feature-level explanations that identify important node attributes for predictions. These explanations create privacy risks. Combined with auxiliary information, feature explanations can enable adversaries to reconstruct graph structure, exposing sensitive relationships. Existing graph reconstruction attacks assume access to original auxiliary data, but practical systems use differential privacy to protect node features and labels while providing explanations for transparency. We study a threat model where adversaries access public feature explanations along with privatized node features and labels. We show that existing explanation-based attacks like GSEF perform poorly with privatized data due to noise from differential privacy mechanisms. We propose ReconXF, a graph reconstruction attack for scenarios with public explanations and privatized auxiliary data. Our method adapts explanation-based frameworks by incorporating denoising mechanisms that handle differential privacy noise while exploiting structural signals in explanations. Experiments across multiple datasets show ReconXF outperforms SoTA methods in privatized settings, with improvements in AUC and average precision. Results indicate that public explanations combined with denoising enable graph structure recovery even under the privacy protection of auxiliary data. Code is available at (link to be made public after acceptance).

**Authors**: Chayadon Lumbut, Donlapark Ponnoprat

**Abstract**: This study investigates privacy leakage in dimensionality reduction methods through a novel machine learning-based reconstruction attack. Employing an informed adversary threat model, we develop a neural network capable of reconstructing high-dimensional data from low-dimensional embeddings.   We evaluate six popular dimensionality reduction techniques: principal component analysis (PCA), sparse random projection (SRP), multidimensional scaling (MDS), Isomap, $t$-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Using both MNIST and NIH Chest X-ray datasets, we perform a qualitative analysis to identify key factors affecting reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of an additive noise mechanism in mitigating these reconstruction attacks. Our experimental results on both datasets reveal that the attack is effective against deterministic methods (PCA and Isomap). but ineffective against methods that employ random initialization (SRP, MDS, $t$-SNE and UMAP). The experimental results also show that, for PCA and Isomap, our reconstruction network produces higher quality outputs compared to a previously proposed network.   We also study the effect of additive noise mechanism to prevent the reconstruction attack. Our experiment shows that, when adding the images with large noises before performing PCA or Isomap, the attack produced severely distorted reconstructions. In contrast, for the other four methods, the reconstructions still show some recognizable features, though they bear little resemblance to the original images.

**Authors**: Sanghyun Hong, Nicholas Carlini, Alexey Kurakin

**Abstract**: We present a certified defense to clean-label poisoning attacks under $\ell_2$-norm. These attacks work by injecting a small number of poisoning samples (e.g., 1%) that contain bounded adversarial perturbations into the training data to induce a targeted misclassification of a test-time input. Inspired by the adversarial robustness achieved by $randomized$ $smoothing$, we show how an off-the-shelf diffusion denoising model can sanitize the tampered training data. We extensively test our defense against seven clean-label poisoning attacks in both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$-norms and reduce their attack success to 0-16% with only a negligible drop in the test accuracy. We compare our defense with existing countermeasures against clean-label poisoning, showing that the defense reduces the attack success the most and offers the best model utility. Our results highlight the need for future work on developing stronger clean-label attacks and using our certified yet practical defense as a strong baseline to evaluate these attacks.

**Authors**: Artun Saday, Yaşar Cahit Yıldırım, Cem Tekin

**Abstract**: We address the problem of Gaussian Process (GP) optimization in the presence of unknown and potentially varying adversarial perturbations. Unlike traditional robust optimization approaches that focus on maximizing performance under worst-case scenarios, we consider a robust satisficing objective, where the goal is to consistently achieve a predefined performance threshold $\tau$, even under adversarial conditions. We propose two novel algorithms based on distinct formulations of robust satisficing, and show that they are instances of a general robust satisficing framework. Further, each algorithm offers different guarantees depending on the nature of the adversary. Specifically, we derive two regret bounds: one that is sublinear over time, assuming certain conditions on the adversary and the satisficing threshold $\tau$, and another that scales with the perturbation magnitude but requires no assumptions on the adversary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the established robust optimization methods in achieving the satisficing objective, particularly when the ambiguity set of the robust optimization framework is inaccurately specified.

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

**Authors**: Kaixun Jiang, Zhaoyu Chen, Haijing Guo, Jinglun Li, Jiyuan Fu, Pinxue Guo, Hao Tang, Bo Li, Wenqiang Zhang

**Abstract**: Preference alignment in diffusion models has primarily focused on benign human preferences (e.g., aesthetic). In this paper, we propose a novel perspective: framing unrestricted adversarial example generation as a problem of aligning with adversary preferences. Unlike benign alignment, adversarial alignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency and attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward hacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address this, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework that decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable rewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency using rule-based similarity reward. In the second stage, APA updates either the image latent or prompt embedding based on feedback from a substitute classifier, guided by trajectory-level and step-wise rewards. To enhance black-box transferability, we further incorporate a diffusion augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that APA achieves significantly better attack transferability while maintaining high visual consistency, inspiring further research to approach adversarial attacks from an alignment perspective. Code will be available at https://github.com/deep-kaixun/APA.

**Authors**: Sujeevan Aseervatham, Achraf Kerzazi, Younès Bennani

**Abstract**: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset, detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.



## **40. CSVAR: Enhancing Visual Privacy in Federated Learning via Adaptive Shuffling Against Overfitting**

**Authors**: Zhuo Chen, Zhenya Ma, Yan Zhang, Donghua Cai, Ye Zhang, Qiushi Li, Yongheng Deng, Ye Guo, Ju Ren, Xuemin, Shen

**Abstract**: Although federated learning preserves training data within local privacy domains, the aggregated model parameters may still reveal private characteristics. This vulnerability stems from clients' limited training data, which predisposes models to overfitting. Such overfitting enables models to memorize distinctive patterns from training samples, thereby amplifying the success probability of privacy attacks like membership inference. To enhance visual privacy protection in FL, we present CSVAR(Channel-Wise Spatial Image Shuffling with Variance-Guided Adaptive Region Partitioning), a novel image shuffling framework to generate obfuscated images for secure data transmission and each training epoch, addressing both overfitting-induced privacy leaks and raw image transmission risks. CSVAR adopts region-variance as the metric to measure visual privacy sensitivity across image regions. Guided by this, CSVAR adaptively partitions each region into multiple blocks, applying fine-grained partitioning to privacy-sensitive regions with high region-variances for enhancing visual privacy protection and coarse-grained partitioning to privacy-insensitive regions for balancing model utility. In each region, CSVAR then shuffles between blocks in both the spatial domains and chromatic channels to hide visual spatial features and disrupt color distribution. Experimental evaluations conducted on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that CSVAR is capable of generating visually obfuscated images that exhibit high perceptual ambiguity to human eyes, simultaneously mitigating the effectiveness of adversarial data reconstruction attacks and achieving a good trade-off between visual privacy protection and model utility.

**Abstract**: The integration of visual and textual data in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models is crucial for enhancing vision-language understanding. However, the adversarial robustness of these models, especially in the alignment of image-text features, has not yet been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel gradient-based multimodal adversarial attack method, underpinned by contrastive learning, to improve the transferability of multimodal adversarial samples in VLP models. This method concurrently generates adversarial texts and images within imperceptive perturbation, employing both image-text and intra-modal contrastive loss. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on image-text retrieval and visual entailment tasks, using publicly available datasets in a black-box setting. Extensive experiments indicate a significant advancement over existing single-modal transfer-based adversarial attack methods and current multimodal adversarial attack approaches.

**Authors**: Craig Steven Wright

**Abstract**: This paper presents a mathematically rigorous formal analysis of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients, as specified in Section 8 of the original Bitcoin white paper, versus non-mining full nodes operated by home users. It defines security as resistance to divergence from global consensus and models transaction acceptance, enforcement capability, and divergence probability under adversarial conditions. The results demonstrate that SPV clients, despite omitting script verification, are cryptographically sufficient under honest-majority assumptions and topologically less vulnerable to attack than structurally passive, non-enforcing full nodes. The paper introduces new axioms on behavioral divergence and communication topology, proving that home-based full nodes increase systemic entropy without contributing to consensus integrity. Using a series of formally defined lemmas, propositions, and Monte Carlo simulation results, it is shown that SPV clients represent the rational equilibrium strategy for non-mining participants. This challenges the prevailing narrative that home validators enhance network security, providing formal and operational justifications for the sufficiency of SPV models.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities by integrating visual information and other types, thus aligning more closely with the nature of human intelligence, which processes a variety of data forms beyond just text. Despite advancements, the undesirable generation of these models remains a critical concern, particularly due to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based jailbreak attacks, which have represented a significant threat by challenging existing safety protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a universal adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the interaction of image-text modalities can be used as a critical vulnerability but also validates that multimodal universal jailbreak attacks can bring higher-quality undesirable generations across different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable context generation of MLLMs like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and InstructBLIP, and reveal significant multimodal safety alignment issues, highlighting the inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated multimodal attacks. This study underscores the urgent need for robust safety measures in MLLMs, advocating for a comprehensive review and enhancement of security protocols to mitigate potential risks associated with multimodal capabilities.

**Authors**: Jingfu Peng, Yuhong Yang

**Abstract**: Despite tremendous advancements of machine learning models and algorithms in various application domains, they are known to be vulnerable to subtle, natural or intentionally crafted perturbations in future input data, known as adversarial attacks. While numerous adversarial learning methods have been proposed, fundamental questions about their statistical optimality in robust loss remain largely unanswered. In particular, the minimax rate of convergence and the construction of rate-optimal estimators under future $X$-attacks are yet to be worked out.   In this paper, we address this issue in the context of nonparametric regression, under suitable assumptions on the smoothness of the regression function and the geometric structure of the input perturbation set. We first establish the minimax rate of convergence under adversarial $L_q$-risks with $1 \leq q \leq \infty$ and propose a piecewise local polynomial estimator that achieves the minimax optimality. The established minimax rate elucidates how the smoothness level and perturbation magnitude affect the fundamental limit of adversarial learning under future $X$-attacks. Furthermore, we construct a data-driven adaptive estimator that is shown to achieve, within a logarithmic factor, the optimal rate across a broad scale of nonparametric and adversarial classes.

**Abstract**: In the domain of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) has been recognized for its innovative ability to adapt to new tasks, relying on examples rather than retraining or fine-tuning. This paper delves into the critical issue of ICL's susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, an area not yet fully explored. We wonder whether ICL is vulnerable, with adversaries capable of manipulating example data to degrade model performance. To address this, we introduce ICLPoison, a specialized attacking framework conceived to exploit the learning mechanisms of ICL. Our approach uniquely employs discrete text perturbations to strategically influence the hidden states of LLMs during the ICL process. We outline three representative strategies to implement attacks under our framework, each rigorously evaluated across a variety of models and tasks. Our comprehensive tests, including trials on the sophisticated GPT-4 model, demonstrate that ICL's performance is significantly compromised under our framework. These revelations indicate an urgent need for enhanced defense mechanisms to safeguard the integrity and reliability of LLMs in applications relying on in-context learning.

**Abstract**: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have revolutionized complex problem-solving capability by enabling sophisticated agent collaboration through message-based communications. While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems.

**Authors**: Sen Fang, Weiyuan Ding, Bowen Xu

**Abstract**: Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.

**Authors**: Bennett Kleinberg, Riccardo Loconte, Bruno Verschuere

**Abstract**: Background: Deception detection through analysing language is a promising avenue using both human judgments and automated machine learning judgments. For both forms of credibility assessment, automated adversarial attacks that rewrite deceptive statements to appear truthful pose a serious threat. Methods: We used a dataset of 243 truthful and 262 fabricated autobiographical stories in a deception detection task for humans and machine learning models. A large language model was tasked to rewrite deceptive statements so that they appear truthful. In Study 1, humans who made a deception judgment or used the detailedness heuristic and two machine learning models (a fine-tuned language model and a simple n-gram model) judged original or adversarial modifications of deceptive statements. In Study 2, we manipulated the target alignment of the modifications, i.e. tailoring the attack to whether the statements would be assessed by humans or computer models. Results: When adversarial modifications were aligned with their target, human (d=-0.07 and d=-0.04) and machine judgments (51% accuracy) dropped to the chance level. When the attack was not aligned with the target, both human heuristics judgments (d=0.30 and d=0.36) and machine learning predictions (63-78%) were significantly better than chance. Conclusions: Easily accessible language models can effectively help anyone fake deception detection efforts both by humans and machine learning models. Robustness against adversarial modifications for humans and machines depends on that target alignment. We close with suggestions on advancing deception research with adversarial attack designs and techniques.

**Authors**: Yudong Zhang, Ruobing Xie, Yiqing Huang, Jiansheng Chen, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Di Wang, Yu Wang

**Abstract**: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.

**Authors**: Attila Szász, Balázs Bánhelyi, Márk Jelasity

**Abstract**: The ultimate goal of verification is to guarantee the safety of deployed neural networks. Here, we claim that all the state-of-the-art verifiers we are aware of fail to reach this goal. Our key insight is that theoretical soundness (bounding the full-precision output while computing with floating point) does not imply practical soundness (bounding the floating point output in a potentially stochastic environment). We prove this observation for the approaches that are currently used to achieve provable theoretical soundness, such as interval analysis and its variants. We also argue that achieving practical soundness is significantly harder computationally. We support our claims empirically as well by evaluating several well-known verification methods. To mislead the verifiers, we create adversarial networks that detect and exploit features of the deployment environment, such as the order and precision of floating point operations. We demonstrate that all the tested verifiers are vulnerable to our new deployment-specific attacks, which proves that they are not practically sound.
