**Authors**: Dominik Luszczynski

**Abstract**: A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.

**Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

**Authors**: Mohamed Rissal Hedna, Sesugh Samuel Nder

**Abstract**: Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.



## **4. FedPoisonTTP: A Threat Model and Poisoning Attack for Federated Test-Time Personalization**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19248v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19248v1)

**Authors**: Md Akil Raihan Iftee, Syed Md. Ahnaf Hasan, Amin Ahsan Ali, AKM Mahbubur Rahman, Sajib Mistry, Aneesh Krishna

**Abstract**: Test-time personalization in federated learning enables models at clients to adjust online to local domain shifts, enhancing robustness and personalization in deployment. Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance.



## **5. Adversarial Attack-Defense Co-Evolution for LLM Safety Alignment via Tree-Group Dual-Aware Search and Optimization**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19218v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19218v1)

**Authors**: Xurui Li, Kaisong Song, Rui Zhu, Pin-Yu Chen, Haixu Tang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.



## **6. Learning to Compress Graphs via Dual Agents for Consistent Topological Robustness Evaluation**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18958v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18958v1)

**Authors**: Qisen Chai, Yansong Wang, Junjie Huang, Tao Jia

**Abstract**: As graph-structured data grow increasingly large, evaluating their robustness under adversarial attacks becomes computationally expensive and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to compress graphs into compact representations that preserve both topological structure and robustness profile, enabling efficient and reliable evaluation.We propose Cutter, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework composed of a Vital Detection Agent (VDA) and a Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA), which collaboratively identify structurally vital and redundant nodes for guided compression. Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both highand low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration. Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity.



## **7. Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Exploits with Responsible AI Considerations**

cs.CR

20 pages including appendix; technical report; NeurIPS 2024 style

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18933v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18933v1)

**Authors**: Ryan Wong, Hosea David Yu Fei Ng, Dhananjai Sharma, Glenn Jun Jie Ng, Kavishvaran Srinivasan

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

## **8. BackdoorVLM: A Benchmark for Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language Models**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18921v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18921v1)

**Authors**: Juncheng Li, Yige Li, Hanxun Huang, Yunhao Chen, Xin Wang, Yixu Wang, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Abstract**: Backdoor attacks undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems by injecting hidden behaviors that can be maliciously activated at inference time. While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\% yielding over 90\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

## **9. Now You See It, Now You Don't - Instant Concept Erasure for Safe Text-to-Image and Video Generation**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18684v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18684v1)

**Authors**: Shristi Das Biswas, Arani Roy, Kaushik Roy

**Abstract**: Robust concept removal for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models is essential for their safe deployment. Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.

**Authors**: Harrison Bagley, Will Meakin, Simon Lucey, Yee Wei Law, Tat-Jun Chin

**Abstract**: Physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems is concerning due to the ease of deploying such attacks, usually by placing an adversarial patch in a scene to manipulate the outcomes of a deep learning model. Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions.

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18588v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18588v1)

**Authors**: Souvik Das, Avishek Ghosh, Debasish Chatterjee

**Abstract**: This article introduces an anomaly detection based algorithm (AD-CPS) to detect false data injection attacks that fall under the category of data deception/integrity attacks, but with arbitrary information structure, in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) modeled as stochastic linear time-invariant systems. The core idea of this data-driven algorithm is based on the fact that an honest state (one not compromised by adversaries) generated by the CPS should concentrate near its weighted empirical mean of the immediate past samples. As the first theoretical result, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the false positive error incurred by the algorithm for attacks that are 2-step honest, referring to adversaries that act intermittently rather than successively. Moreover, we establish that for adversaries possessing a certain minimum energy, the false negative error incurred by AD-CPS is low. Extensive experiments were conducted on partially observed stochastic LTI systems to demonstrate these properties and to quantitatively compare AD-CPS with an optimal CUSUM-based test.



## **12. Zero-Trust Strategies for O-RAN Cellular Networks: Principles, Challenges and Research Directions**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18568v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18568v1)

**Authors**: Charalampos Katsis, Imtiaz Karim, Elisa Bertino

**Abstract**: Cellular networks have become foundational to modern communication, supporting a broad range of applications, from civilian use to enterprise systems and military tactical networks. The advent of fifth-generation and beyond cellular networks (B5G) introduces emerging compute capabilities into the Radio Access Network (RAN), transforming it from a traditionally closed, vendor-locked infrastructure into an open and programmable ecosystem. This evolution, exemplified by Open-RAN (O-RAN), enables the deployment of control-plane applications from diverse sources, which can dynamically influence user-plane traffic in response to real-time events. As cellular infrastructures become more disaggregated and software-driven, security becomes an increasingly critical concern. Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a promising security paradigm that discards implicit trust assumptions by acknowledging that threats may arise from both external and internal sources. ZTA mandates comprehensive and fine-grained security mechanisms across both control and user planes to contain adversarial movements and enhance breach detection and attack response actions. In this paper, we explore the adoption of ZTA in the context of 5G and beyond, with a particular focus on O-RAN as an architectural enabler. We analyze how ZTA principles align with the architectural and operational characteristics of O-RAN, and identify key challenges and opportunities for embedding zero-trust mechanisms within O-RAN-based cellular networks.



## **13. Ensuring Calibration Robustness in Split Conformal Prediction Under Adversarial Attacks**

Submitted to AISTATS 2026

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-23    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18562v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18562v1)

**Authors**: Xunlei Qian, Yue Xing

**Abstract**: Conformal prediction (CP) provides distribution-free, finite-sample coverage guarantees but critically relies on exchangeability, a condition often violated under distribution shift. We study the robustness of split conformal prediction under adversarial perturbations at test time, focusing on both coverage validity and the resulting prediction set size. Our theoretical analysis characterizes how the strength of adversarial perturbations during calibration affects coverage guarantees under adversarial test conditions. We further examine the impact of adversarial training at the model-training stage. Extensive experiments support our theory: (i) Prediction coverage varies monotonically with the calibration-time attack strength, enabling the use of nonzero calibration-time attack to predictably control coverage under adversarial tests; (ii) target coverage can hold over a range of test-time attacks: with a suitable calibration attack, coverage stays within any chosen tolerance band across a contiguous set of perturbation levels; and (iii) adversarial training at the training stage produces tighter prediction sets that retain high informativeness.

**Authors**: H. Zhang, L. Zhang, G. Epiphaniou, C. Maple

**Abstract**: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in defending modern cyber physical systems against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.



## **15. Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training**

cs.LG

Accepted by AAAI26

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-22    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18138v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18138v1)

**Authors**: Junrui Zhang, Xinyu Zhao, Jie Peng, Chenjie Wang, Jianmin Ji, Tianlong Chen

**Abstract**: Multimodal learning has shown significant superiority on various tasks by integrating multiple modalities. However, the interdependencies among modalities increase the susceptibility of multimodal models to adversarial attacks. Existing methods mainly focus on attacks on specific modalities or indiscriminately attack all modalities. In this paper, we find that these approaches ignore the differences between modalities in their contribution to final robustness, resulting in suboptimal robustness performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality. To be specific, VARMAT first explicitly quantifies the vulnerability of each modality, grounded in a first-order approximation of the attack objective (Probe). Then, we propose a targeted regularization term that penalizes modalities with high vulnerability, guiding robust learning while maintaining task accuracy (Training). We demonstrate the enhanced robustness of our method across multiple multimodal datasets involving diverse modalities. Finally, we achieve {12.73%, 22.21%, 11.19%} robustness improvement on three multimodal datasets, revealing a significant blind spot in multimodal adversarial training.



## **16. Federated Anomaly Detection and Mitigation for EV Charging Forecasting Under Cyberattacks**

cs.LG

6 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-22    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17978v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17978v1)

**Authors**: Oluleke Babayomi, Dong-Seong Kim

**Abstract**: Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure faces escalating cybersecurity threats that can severely compromise operational efficiency and grid stability. Existing forecasting techniques are limited by the lack of combined robust anomaly mitigation solutions and data privacy preservation. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%). The proposed architecture enables enhanced EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving collaborative forecasting, cybersecurity resilience, and rapid recovery from malicious threats across distributed charging networks.



## **17. Adversarial Pseudo-replay for Exemplar-free Class-incremental Learning**

cs.CV

Accepted to WACV 2026

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-22    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17973v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17973v1)

**Authors**: Hiroto Honda

**Abstract**: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to retain old knowledge acquired in the previous task while learning new classes, without storing the previous images due to storage constraints or privacy concerns. In EFCIL, the plasticity-stability dilemma, learning new tasks versus catastrophic forgetting, is a significant challenge, primarily due to the unavailability of images from earlier tasks. In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples. Our method reconciles stability and plasticity, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging cold-start settings of the standard EFCIL benchmarks.



## **18. StealthCup: Realistic, Multi-Stage, Evasion-Focused CTF for Benchmarking IDS**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17761v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17761v1)

**Authors**: Manuel Kern, Dominik Steffan, Felix Schuster, Florian Skopik, Max Landauer, David Allison, Simon Freudenthaler, Edgar Weippl

**Abstract**: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical to defending enterprise and industrial control environments, yet evaluating their effectiveness under realistic conditions remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on synthetic datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) or scripted replay frameworks, which fail to capture adaptive adversary behavior. Even MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations, while influential, are host-centric and assume malware-driven compromise, thereby under-representing stealthy, multi-stage intrusions across IT and OT domains. We present StealthCup, a novel evaluation methodology that operationalizes IDS benchmarking as an evasion-focused Capture-the-Flag competition. Professional penetration testers engaged in multi-stage attack chains on a realistic IT/OT testbed, with scoring penalizing IDS detections. The event generated structured attacker writeups, validated detections, and PCAPs, host logs, and alerts. Our results reveal that out of 32 exercised attack techniques, 11 were not detected by any IDS configuration. Open-source systems (Wazuh, Suricata) produced high false-positive rates >90%, while commercial tools generated fewer false positives but also missed more attacks. Comparison with the Volt Typhoon APT advisory confirmed strong realism: all 28 applicable techniques were exercised, 19 appeared in writeups, and 9 in forensic traces. These findings demonstrate that StealthCup elicits attacker behavior closely aligned with state-sponsored TTPs, while exposing blind spots across both open-source and commercial IDS. The resulting datasets and methodology provide a reproducible foundation for future stealth-focused IDS evaluation.



## **19. ATAC: Augmentation-Based Test-Time Adversarial Correction for CLIP**

cs.CV

16 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17362v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17362v1)

**Authors**: Linxiang Su, András Balogh

**Abstract**: Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17688v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17688v1)

**Authors**: Quan Liu, Feng Ye, Chenhao Lu, Shuming Zhen, Guanliang Huang, Lunzhe Chen, Xudong Ke

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks introduce small, deliberately crafted perturbations that mislead neural networks, and their transferability from white-box to black-box target models remains a critical research focus. Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments.

**Abstract**: Language agents are rapidly expanding from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators in shared workspaces and groups. However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17666v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17666v1)

**Authors**: Tom Perel

**Abstract**: The recent boom and rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications warrants a deeper understanding of their security and safety vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.

**Abstract**: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16229v1) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16229v1)

**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Zhe Li, Yige Li, Jun Sun

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

## **25. When Alignment Fails: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models**

**Authors**: Yuping Yan, Yuhan Xie, Yixin Zhang, Lingjuan Lyu, Handing Wang, Yaochu Jin

**Abstract**: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

**Authors**: Vu Van Than

**Abstract**: Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.



## **27. SoK: Security Evaluation of Wi-Fi CSI Biometrics: Attacks, Metrics, and Open Challenges**

**Abstract**: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been repeatedly proposed as a biometric modality, often with reports of high accuracy and operational feasibility. However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security lens, analyzing how existing works diverge in sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility.   To this end, we construct a unified evaluation framework to expose these issues empirically and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics such as per-class EER, Frequency Count of Scores (FCS), and the Gini Coefficient uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. The resulting analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces--including replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation--and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.



## **28. Privacy on the Fly: A Predictive Adversarial Transformation Network for Mobile Sensor Data**

cs.CR

accepted by AAAI 2026 (oral)

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-24    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07242v4) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07242v4)

**Authors**: Tianle Song, Chenhao Lin, Yang Cao, Zhengyu Zhao, Jiahao Sun, Chong Zhang, Le Yang, Chao Shen

**Abstract**: Mobile motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes are now ubiquitously accessible by third-party apps via standard APIs. While enabling rich functionalities like activity recognition and step counting, this openness has also enabled unregulated inference of sensitive user traits, such as gender, age, and even identity, without user consent. Existing privacy-preserving techniques, such as GAN-based obfuscation or differential privacy, typically require access to the full input sequence, introducing latency that is incompatible with real-time scenarios. Worse, they tend to distort temporal and semantic patterns, degrading the utility of the data for benign tasks like activity recognition. To address these limitations, we propose the Predictive Adversarial Transformation Network (PATN), a real-time privacy-preserving framework that leverages historical signals to generate adversarial perturbations proactively. The perturbations are applied immediately upon data acquisition, enabling continuous protection without disrupting application functionality. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PATN substantially degrades the performance of privacy inference models, achieving Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 40.11% and 44.65% (reducing inference accuracy to near-random) and increasing the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 8.30% and 7.56% to 41.65% and 46.22%. On ASR, PATN outperforms baseline methods by 16.16% and 31.96%, respectively.

**SubmitDate**: 2025-11-22    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26451v2) [paper-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26451v2)

**Authors**: Jiayi Luo, Qingyun Sun, Beining Yang, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Yanbiao Ma, Jianxin Li, Philip S. Yu

**Abstract**: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity. Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.



## **30. GhostEI-Bench: Do Mobile Agents Resilience to Environmental Injection in Dynamic On-Device Environments?**

**Authors**: Chiyu Chen, Xinhao Song, Yunkai Chai, Yang Yao, Haodong Zhao, Lijun Li, Jie Li, Yan Teng, Gongshen Liu, Yingchun Wang

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more robust and secure embodied agents.

**Authors**: Yuwen Cui, Guangjing Wang, Khanh Vu, Kai Wei, Kehan Shen, Zhengyuan Jiang, Xiao Han, Ning Wang, Zhuo Lu, Yao Liu

**Abstract**: The Tor network provides users with strong anonymity by routing their internet traffic through multiple relays. While Tor encrypts traffic and hides IP addresses, it remains vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks such as the website fingerprinting (WF) attack, achieving increasingly high fingerprinting accuracy even under open-world conditions. In response, researchers have proposed a variety of defenses, ranging from adaptive padding, traffic regularization, and traffic morphing to adversarial perturbation, that seek to obfuscate or reshape traffic traces. However, these defenses often entail trade-offs between privacy, usability, and system performance. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive survey unifying WF datasets, attack methodologies, and defense strategies remains absent. This paper fills that gap by systematically categorizing existing WF research into three key domains: datasets, attack models, and defense mechanisms. We provide an in-depth comparative analysis of techniques, highlight their strengths and limitations under diverse threat models, and discuss emerging challenges such as multi-tab browsing and coarse-grained traffic features. By consolidating prior work and identifying open research directions, this survey serves as a foundation for advancing stronger privacy protection in Tor.



## **32. Time-To-Inconsistency: A Survival Analysis of Large Language Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks**

**Authors**: Yubo Li, Ramayya Krishnan, Rema Padman

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems.

**Authors**: Roie Kazoom, Yuval Ratzabi, Etamar Rothstein, Ofer Hadar

**Abstract**: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

**Authors**: Aravindhan G, Yuvaraj Govindarajulu, Parin Shah

**Abstract**: Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of Automatic Speech Recognition systems to adversarial examples, which can deceive these systems into misinterpreting input speech commands. While previous research has primarily focused on white-box attacks with constrained optimizations, and transferability based black-box attacks against commercial Automatic Speech Recognition devices, this paper explores cost efficient white-box attack and non transferability black-box adversarial attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition systems, drawing insights from approaches such as Fast Gradient Sign Method and Zeroth-Order Optimization. Further, the novelty of the paper includes how poisoning attack can degrade the performances of state-of-the-art models leading to misinterpretation of audio signals. Through experimentation and analysis, we illustrate how hybrid models can generate subtle yet impactful adversarial examples with very little perturbation having Signal Noise Ratio of 35dB that can be generated within a minute. These vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art open source model have practical security implications, and emphasize the need for adversarial security.

**Authors**: Praneet Suresh, Jack Stanley, Sonia Joseph, Luca Scimeca, Danilo Bzdok

**Abstract**: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science, business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic quantification of a model's hallucination risk.



## **36. Fine-Grained Privacy Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems via Knowledge Asymmetry Exploitation**

cs.CR

**Authors**: Yufei Chen, Yao Wang, Haibin Zhang, Tao Gu

**Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, but this advancement introduces significant privacy risks. Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger data leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived sentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across multiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel black-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and standard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous knowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that creates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content. Specifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information disparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and syntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature scores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike prior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative refinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we achieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in multi-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in case studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG systems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a foundation for adaptive mitigation.

**Authors**: Zhipeng He, Alexander Stevens, Chun Ouyang, Johannes De Smedt, Alistair Barros, Catarina Moreira

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present unique challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions. To address this, we propose a latent-space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate statistically consistent adversarial examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency. We introduce In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to jointly evaluate attack effectiveness and distributional alignment. Evaluation across six publicly available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted from image domain approaches, achieving substantially lower outlier rates and higher IDSR across six datasets and three model architectures. Our comprehensive analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control, and generative architecture demonstrate that the effectiveness of VAE-based attacks depends strongly on reconstruction quality and the availability of sufficient training data. When these conditions are met, the proposed framework achieves superior practical utility and stability compared with input-space methods. This work underscores the importance of maintaining on-manifold perturbations for generating realistic and robust adversarial examples in tabular domains.

**Authors**: Deepak Kumar Panda, Weisi Guo

**Abstract**: Autonomous UAV navigation using reinforcement learning (RL) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate sensor inputs, potentially leading to unsafe behavior and mission failure. Although robust RL methods provide partial protection, they often struggle to generalize to unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks due to their reliance on fixed perturbation settings. To address this limitation, we propose a meta-policy switching framework in which a meta-level polic dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to counter unknown adversarial shifts. At the core of this framework lies a discounted Thompson sampling (DTS) mechanism that formulates policy selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, thereby minimizing value distribution shifts via self-induced adversarial observations. We first construct a diverse ensemble of action-robust policies trained under varying perturbation intensities. The DTS-based meta-policy then adaptively selects among these policies online, optimizing resilience against self-induced, piecewise-stationary attacks. Theoretical analysis shows that the DTS mechanism minimizes expected regret, ensuring adaptive robustness to OOD attacks and exhibiting emergent antifragile behavior under uncertainty. Extensive simulations in complex 3D obstacle environments under both white-box (Projected Gradient Descent) and black-box (GPS spoofing) attacks demonstrate significantly improved navigation efficiency and higher conflict free trajectory rates compared to standard robust and vanilla RL baselines, highlighting the practical security and dependability benefits of the proposed approach.

**Abstract**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, their inherent tendency toward verbatim memorization of training data introduces critical risks like copyright infringement, insecure emission, and deprecated API utilization, etc. A straightforward yet promising defense is unlearning, ie., erasing or down-weighting the offending snippets through post-training. However, we find its application to source code often tends to spill over, damaging the basic knowledge of programming languages learned by the LLM and degrading the overall capability. To ease this challenge, we propose PROD for precise source code unlearning. PROD surgically zeroes out the prediction probability of the prohibited tokens, and renormalizes the remaining distribution so that the generated code stays correct. By excising only the targeted snippets, PROD achieves precise forgetting without much degradation of the LLM's overall capability. To facilitate in-depth evaluation against PROD, we establish an unlearning benchmark consisting of three downstream tasks (ie., unlearning of copyrighted code, insecure code, and deprecated APIs), and introduce Pareto Dominance Ratio (PDR) metric, which indicates both the forget quality and the LLM utility. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior overall performance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. These results underscore that our approach not only successfully extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.

**Authors**: Patryk Krukowski, Łukasz Gorczyca, Piotr Helm, Kamil Książek, Przemysław Spurek

**Abstract**: Continual learning under adversarial conditions remains an open problem, as existing methods often compromise either robustness, scalability, or both. We propose a novel framework that integrates Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) with a hypernetwork-based architecture to enable certifiably robust continual learning across sequential tasks. Our method, SHIELD, generates task-specific model parameters via a shared hypernetwork conditioned solely on compact task embeddings, eliminating the need for replay buffers or full model copies and enabling efficient over time. To further enhance robustness, we introduce Interval MixUp, a novel training strategy that blends virtual examples represented as $\ell_{\infty}$ balls centered around MixUp points. Leveraging interval arithmetic, this technique guarantees certified robustness while mitigating the wrapping effect, resulting in smoother decision boundaries. We evaluate SHIELD under strong white-box adversarial attacks, including PGD and AutoAttack, across multiple benchmarks. It consistently outperforms existing robust continual learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art average accuracy while maintaining both scalability and certification. These results represent a significant step toward practical and theoretically grounded continual learning in adversarial settings.

**Authors**: Hangoo Kang, Jehyeok Yeon, Gagandeep Singh

**Abstract**: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a novel generative adversarial framework that manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic injections into the vision-language embedding space. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios, TRAP consistently induces decision-level preference redirection on leading models, including LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, GPT-4o, and Mistral-3.2, significantly outperforming existing baselines such as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These findings expose a critical, generalized vulnerability: autonomous agents can be consistently misled through visually subtle, semantically-guided cross-modal manipulations. Overall, our results show the need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.

**Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is instrumental for inhibiting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) through the use of a factual knowledge base (KB). Although PDF documents are prominent sources of knowledge, text-based RAG pipelines are ineffective at capturing their rich multi-modal information. In contrast, visual document RAG (VD-RAG) uses screenshots of document pages as the KB, which has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, by introducing the image modality, VD-RAG introduces new attack vectors for adversaries to disrupt the system by injecting malicious documents into the KB. In this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerability of VD-RAG to poisoning attacks targeting both retrieval and generation. We define two attack objectives and demonstrate that both can be realized by injecting only a single adversarial image into the KB. Firstly, we introduce a targeted attack against one or a group of queries with the goal of spreading targeted disinformation. Secondly, we present a universal attack that, for any potential user query, influences the response to cause a denial-of-service in the VD-RAG system. We investigate the two attack objectives under both white-box and black-box assumptions, employing a multi-objective gradient-based optimization approach as well as prompting state-of-the-art generative models. Using two visual document datasets, a diverse set of state-of-the-art retrievers (embedding models) and generators (vision language models), we show VD-RAG is vulnerable to poisoning attacks in both the targeted and universal settings, yet demonstrating robustness to black-box attacks in the universal setting.

**Abstract**: The robustness of deep neural networks is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments (e.g., medical or driving scenarios) where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remains underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing novel, region-aware metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, along with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of natural localized corruptions. Furthermore, it uncovers the inherent complexity of evaluating worst-case spatial robustness using only a single localized adversarial attack. To address this, the work proposes a region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis to systematically assess model robustness across specific image regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones, and vice versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.

**Authors**: Chenyu Zhang, Lanjun Wang, Yiwen Ma, Wenhui Li, An-An Liu

**Abstract**: Text-to-Image(T2I) models typically deploy safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design instructions for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.

**Authors**: Hamed Poursiami, Ayana Moshruba, Maryam Parsa

**Abstract**: As machine learning models become integral to security-sensitive applications, concerns over data leakage from adversarial attacks continue to rise. Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by enabling adversaries to reconstruct training data from model outputs. While MI attacks on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely studied, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) remain largely unexplored in this context. Due to their event-driven and discrete computations, SNNs introduce fundamental differences in information processing that may offer inherent resistance to such attacks. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this threat lies in black-box settings, where attackers operate through queries without direct access to model parameters or gradients-representing a more realistic adversarial scenario in deployed systems. This work presents the first study of black-box MI attacks on SNNs. We adapt a generative adversarial MI framework to the spiking domain by incorporating rate-based encoding for input transformation and decoding mechanisms for output interpretation. Our results show that SNNs exhibit significantly greater resistance to MI attacks than ANNs, as demonstrated by degraded reconstructions, increased instability in attack convergence, and overall reduced attack effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics. Further analysis suggests that the discrete and temporally distributed nature of SNN decision boundaries disrupts surrogate modeling, limiting the attacker's ability to approximate the target model.

**Authors**: Youngjoon Lee, Taehyun Park, Yunho Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly being adopted in military collaborations to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving data sovereignty. However, prompt injection attacks-malicious manipulations of input prompts-pose new threats that may undermine operational security, disrupt decision-making, and erode trust among allies. This perspective paper highlights four vulnerabilities in federated military LLMs: secret data leakage, free-rider exploitation, system disruption, and misinformation spread. To address these risks, we propose a human-AI collaborative framework with both technical and policy countermeasures. On the technical side, our framework uses red/blue team wargaming and quality assurance to detect and mitigate adversarial behaviors of shared LLM weights. On the policy side, it promotes joint AI-human policy development and verification of security protocols.

**Abstract**: With the rapid rise of personalized AI, customized large language models (LLMs) equipped with Chain of Thought (COT) reasoning now power millions of AI agents. However, their complex reasoning processes introduce new and largely unexplored security vulnerabilities. We present DarkMind, a novel latent reasoning level backdoor attack that targets customized LLMs by manipulating internal COT steps without altering user queries. Unlike prior prompt based attacks, DarkMind activates covertly within the reasoning chain via latent triggers, enabling adversarial behaviors without modifying input prompts or requiring access to model parameters. To achieve stealth and reliability, we propose dual trigger types instant and retrospective and integrate them within a unified embedding template that governs trigger dependent activation, employ a stealth optimization algorithm to minimize semantic drift, and introduce an automated conversation starter for covert activation across domains. Comprehensive experiments on eight reasoning datasets spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic domains, using five LLMs, demonstrate that DarkMind consistently achieves high attack success rates. We further investigate defense strategies to mitigate these risks and reveal that reasoning level backdoors represent a significant yet underexplored threat, underscoring the need for robust, reasoning aware security mechanisms.

**Authors**: Andre Kassis, Urs Hengartner, Yaoliang Yu

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) has become a cornerstone defense against adversarial examples (AEs), regarded as robust due to its use of diffusion models (DMs) that project AEs onto the natural data manifold. We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, accrediting it two critical factors: inaccurate gradients and improper evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that when accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient mismatches that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.

**Authors**: Gabriele Oligeri, Savio Sciancalepore

**Abstract**: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) techniques allow a receiver to authenticate a transmitter by analyzing the physical layer of the radio spectrum. Although the vast majority of scientific contributions focus on improving the performance of RFF considering different parameters and scenarios, in this work, we consider RFF as an attack vector to identify a target device in the radio spectrum. \\ We propose, implement, and evaluate {\em HidePrint}, a solution to prevent identification through RFF without affecting the quality of the communication link between the transmitter and the receiver. {\em HidePrint} hides the transmitter's fingerprint against an illegitimate eavesdropper through the injection of controlled noise into the transmitted signal. We evaluate our solution against various state-of-the-art RFF techniques, considering several adversarial models, data from real-world communication links (wired and wireless), and protocol configurations. Our results show that the injection of a Gaussian noise pattern with a normalized standard deviation of (at least) 0.02 prevents device fingerprinting in all the considered scenarios, while affecting the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the received signal by only 0.1 dB. Moreover, we introduce {\em selective radio fingerprint disclosure}, a new technique that allows the transmitter to disclose the radio fingerprint to only a subset of intended receivers.

**Authors**: Shengzhu Shi, Yao Li, Zhichang Guo, Boying Wu, Yang Zhao

**Abstract**: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown great promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, vanilla PINNs often face challenges when solving complex PDEs, especially those involving multi-scale behaviors or solutions with sharp or oscillatory characteristics. To precisely and adaptively locate the critical regions that fail in the solving process we propose a sampling strategy grounded in white-box adversarial attacks, referred to as WbAR. WbAR search for failure regions in the direction of the loss gradient, thus directly locating the most critical positions. WbAR generates adversarial samples in a random walk manner and iteratively refines PINNs to guide the model's focus towards dynamically updated critical regions during training. We implement WbAR to the elliptic equation with multi-scale coefficients, Poisson equation with multi-peak solutions, high-dimensional Poisson equations, and Burgers equation with sharp solutions. The results demonstrate that WbAR can effectively locate and reduce failure regions. Moreover, WbAR is suitable for solving complex PDEs, since locating failure regions through adversarial attacks is independent of the size of failure regions or the complexity of the distribution.
