## **1. Reverse Engineering Human Preferences with Reinforcement Learning**

cs.CL

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15795v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15795v1)

**Authors**: Lisa Alazraki, Tan Yi-Chern, Jon Ander Campos, Maximilian Mozes, Marek Rei, Max Bartolo

**Abstract**: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial attacks.



## **2. Scalable Defense against In-the-wild Jailbreaking Attacks with Safety Context Retrieval**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15753v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15753v1)

**Authors**: Taiye Chen, Zeming Wei, Ang Li, Yisen Wang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics, contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon publication.



## **3. Alignment Under Pressure: The Case for Informed Adversaries When Evaluating LLM Defenses**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15738v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15738v1)

**Authors**: Xiaoxue Yang, Bozhidar Stevanoski, Matthieu Meeus, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.



## **4. Beyond Classification: Evaluating Diffusion Denoised Smoothing for Security-Utility Trade off**

cs.LG

Paper accepted at the 33rd European Signal Processing Conference  (EUSIPCO 2025)

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15594v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15594v1)

**Authors**: Yury Belousov, Brian Pulfer, Vitaliy Kinakh, Slava Voloshynovskiy

**Abstract**: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%. Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to be addressed.



## **5. ModSec-AdvLearn: Countering Adversarial SQL Injections with Robust Machine Learning**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04964v4) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04964v4)

**Authors**: Giuseppe Floris, Christian Scano, Biagio Montaruli, Luca Demetrio, Andrea Valenza, Luca Compagna, Davide Ariu, Luca Piras, Davide Balzarotti, Battista Biggio

**Abstract**: Many Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) leverage the OWASP CRS to block incoming malicious requests. The CRS consists of different sets of rules designed by domain experts to detect well-known web attack patterns. Both the set of rules and the weights used to combine them are manually defined, yielding four different default configurations of the CRS. In this work, we focus on the detection of SQLi attacks, and show that the manual configurations of the CRS typically yield a suboptimal trade-off between detection and false alarm rates. Furthermore, we show that these configurations are not robust to adversarial SQLi attacks, i.e., carefully-crafted attacks that iteratively refine the malicious SQLi payload by querying the target WAF to bypass detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose (i) using machine learning to automate the selection of the set of rules to be combined along with their weights, i.e., customizing the CRS configuration based on the monitored web services; and (ii) leveraging adversarial training to significantly improve its robustness to adversarial SQLi manipulations. Our experiments, conducted using the well-known open-source ModSecurity WAF equipped with the CRS rules, show that our approach, named ModSec-AdvLearn, can (i) increase the detection rate up to 30%, while retaining negligible false alarm rates and discarding up to 50% of the CRS rules; and (ii) improve robustness against adversarial SQLi attacks up to 85%, marking a significant stride toward designing more effective and robust WAFs. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/pralab/modsec-advlearn.



## **6. Audio Jailbreak: An Open Comprehensive Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Audio-Language Models**

cs.SD

We release AJailBench, including both static and optimized  adversarial data, to facilitate future research:  https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/AudioJailbreak

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15406v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15406v1)

**Authors**: Zirui Song, Qian Jiang, Mingxuan Cui, Mingzhe Li, Lang Gao, Zeyu Zhang, Zixiang Xu, Yanbo Wang, Chenxi Wang, Guangxian Ouyang, Zhenhao Chen, Xiuying Chen

**Abstract**: The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and risks, as their audio outputs may contain harmful or unethical content. However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of 1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories, converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency, and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs, underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense mechanisms.



## **7. PoisonArena: Uncovering Competing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

cs.IR

29 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12574v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12574v2)

**Authors**: Liuji Chen, Xiaofang Yang, Yuanzhuo Lu, Jinghao Zhang, Xin Sun, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Jing Dong, Liang Wang

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, widely used to improve the factual grounding of large language models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject manipulated content into the retriever's corpus. While prior research has predominantly focused on single-attacker settings, real-world scenarios often involve multiple, competing attackers with conflicting objectives. In this work, we introduce PoisonArena, the first benchmark to systematically study and evaluate competing poisoning attacks in RAG. We formalize the multi-attacker threat model, where attackers vie to control the answer to the same query using mutually exclusive misinformation. PoisonArena leverages the Bradley-Terry model to quantify each method's competitive effectiveness in such adversarial environments. Through extensive experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, we demonstrate that many attack strategies successful in isolation fail under competitive pressure. Our findings highlight the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) and F1 score and underscore the need for competitive evaluation to assess real-world attack robustness. PoisonArena provides a standardized framework to benchmark and develop future attack and defense strategies under more realistic, multi-adversary conditions.

## **8. My Face Is Mine, Not Yours: Facial Protection Against Diffusion Model Face Swapping**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15336v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15336v1)

**Authors**: Hon Ming Yam, Zhongliang Guo, Chun Pong Lau

**Abstract**: The proliferation of diffusion-based deepfake technologies poses significant risks for unauthorized and unethical facial image manipulation. While traditional countermeasures have primarily focused on passive detection methods, this paper introduces a novel proactive defense strategy through adversarial attacks that preemptively protect facial images from being exploited by diffusion-based deepfake systems. Existing adversarial protection methods predominantly target conventional generative architectures (GANs, AEs, VAEs) and fail to address the unique challenges presented by diffusion models, which have become the predominant framework for high-quality facial deepfakes. Current diffusion-specific adversarial approaches are limited by their reliance on specific model architectures and weights, rendering them ineffective against the diverse landscape of diffusion-based deepfake implementations. Additionally, they typically employ global perturbation strategies that inadequately address the region-specific nature of facial manipulation in deepfakes.



## **9. BadSR: Stealthy Label Backdoor Attacks on Image Super-Resolution**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15308v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15308v1)

**Authors**: Ji Guo, Xiaolei Wen, Wenbo Jiang, Cheng Huang, Jinjin Li, Hongwei Li

**Abstract**: With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields, researchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting downstream tasks.



## **10. Robustness Evaluation of Graph-based News Detection Using Network Structural Information**

cs.SI

Accepted to Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge  Discovery and Data Mining 2025 (KDD 2025). 14 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14453v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14453v2)

**Authors**: Xianghua Zeng, Hao Peng, Angsheng Li

**Abstract**: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising potential in fake news detection, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations within social networks. Existing methods primarily establish connections between malicious accounts and individual target news to investigate the vulnerability of graph-based detectors, while they neglect the structural relationships surrounding targets, limiting their effectiveness in robustness evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-guided Adversarial Attack Framework, namely SI2AF, which effectively challenges graph-based detectors and further probes their detection robustness. Specifically, structural entropy is introduced to quantify the dynamic uncertainty in social engagements and identify hierarchical communities that encompass all user accounts and news posts. An influence metric is presented to measure each account's probability of engaging in random interactions, facilitating the design of multiple agents that manage distinct malicious accounts. For each target news, three attack strategies are developed through multi-agent collaboration within the associated subgraph to optimize evasion against black-box detectors. By incorporating the adversarial manipulations generated by SI2AF, we enrich the original network structure and refine graph-based detectors to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SI2AF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness with an average improvement of 16.71%, and enhances GNN-based detection robustness by 41.54% on average.



## **11. Blind Spot Navigation: Evolutionary Discovery of Sensitive Semantic Concepts for LVLMs**

cs.CV

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15265v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15265v1)

**Authors**: Zihao Pan, Yu Tong, Weibin Wu, Jingyi Wang, Lifeng Chen, Zhe Zhao, Jiajia Wei, Yitong Qiao, Zibin Zheng

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as ``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models (LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework. Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire further in-depth research.



## **12. From Words to Collisions: LLM-Guided Evaluation and Adversarial Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios**

cs.AI

New version of the paper

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02145v3) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02145v3)

**Authors**: Yuan Gao, Mattia Piccinini, Korbinian Moller, Amr Alanwar, Johannes Betz

**Abstract**: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.



## **13. Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning Against View Adversarial Attacks**

cs.LG

11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by IJCAI 2025

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04046v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04046v2)

**Authors**: Xuyang Wang, Siyuan Duan, Qizhi Li, Guiduo Duan, Yuan Sun, Dezhong Peng

**Abstract**: Trustworthy multi-view learning has attracted extensive attention because evidence learning can provide reliable uncertainty estimation to enhance the credibility of multi-view predictions. Existing trusted multi-view learning methods implicitly assume that multi-view data is secure. However, in safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and security monitoring, multi-view data often faces threats from adversarial perturbations, thereby deceiving or disrupting multi-view models. This inevitably leads to the adversarial unreliability problem (AUP) in trusted multi-view learning. To overcome this tricky problem, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework, namely Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning (RDML). Specifically, we first propose evidential disentanglement learning to decompose each view into clean and adversarial parts under the guidance of corresponding evidences, which is extracted by a pretrained evidence extractor. Then, we employ the feature recalibration module to mitigate the negative impact of adversarial perturbations and extract potential informative features from them. Finally, to further ignore the irreparable adversarial interferences, a view-level evidential attention mechanism is designed. Extensive experiments on multi-view classification tasks with adversarial attacks show that RDML outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a relatively large margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/Willy1005/2025-IJCAI-RDML.



## **14. Few-Shot Adversarial Low-Rank Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15130v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15130v1)

**Authors**: Sajjad Ghiasvand, Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Mahnoosh Alizadeh, Ramtin Pedarsani

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD), without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.



## **15. A Survey On Secure Machine Learning**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15124v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15124v1)

**Authors**: Taobo Liao, Taoran Li, Prathamesh Nadkarni

**Abstract**: In this survey, we will explore the interaction between secure multiparty computation and the area of machine learning. Recent advances in secure multiparty computation (MPC) have significantly improved its applicability in the realm of machine learning (ML), offering robust solutions for privacy-preserving collaborative learning. This review explores key contributions that leverage MPC to enable multiple parties to engage in ML tasks without compromising the privacy of their data. The integration of MPC with ML frameworks facilitates the training and evaluation of models on combined datasets from various sources, ensuring that sensitive information remains encrypted throughout the process. Innovations such as specialized software frameworks and domain-specific languages streamline the adoption of MPC in ML, optimizing performance and broadening its usage. These frameworks address both semi-honest and malicious threat models, incorporating features such as automated optimizations and cryptographic auditing to ensure compliance and data integrity. The collective insights from these studies highlight MPC's potential in fostering collaborative yet confidential data analysis, marking a significant stride towards the realization of secure and efficient computational solutions in privacy-sensitive industries. This paper investigates a spectrum of SecureML libraries that includes cryptographic protocols, federated learning frameworks, and privacy-preserving algorithms. By surveying the existing literature, this paper aims to examine the efficacy of these libraries in preserving data privacy, ensuring model confidentiality, and fortifying ML systems against adversarial attacks. Additionally, the study explores an innovative application domain for SecureML techniques: the integration of these methodologies in gaming environments utilizing ML.



## **16. AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-21    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14103v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14103v2)

**Authors**: Guangke Chen, Fu Song, Zhe Zhao, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Yanchen Qiao, Weizhe Zhang

**Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.



## **17. MrGuard: A Multilingual Reasoning Guardrail for Universal LLM Safety**

cs.CL

Preprint

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15241v2) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15241v2)

**Authors**: Yahan Yang, Soham Dan, Shuo Li, Dan Roth, Insup Lee

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.



## **18. Lessons from Defending Gemini Against Indirect Prompt Injections**

cs.CR

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14534v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14534v1)

**Authors**: Chongyang Shi, Sharon Lin, Shuang Song, Jamie Hayes, Ilia Shumailov, Itay Yona, Juliette Pluto, Aneesh Pappu, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Milad Nasr, Chawin Sitawarin, Gena Gibson, Andreas Terzis, John "Four" Flynn

**Abstract**: Gemini is increasingly used to perform tasks on behalf of users, where function-calling and tool-use capabilities enable the model to access user data. Some tools, however, require access to untrusted data introducing risk. Adversaries can embed malicious instructions in untrusted data which cause the model to deviate from the user's expectations and mishandle their data or permissions. In this report, we set out Google DeepMind's approach to evaluating the adversarial robustness of Gemini models and describe the main lessons learned from the process. We test how Gemini performs against a sophisticated adversary through an adversarial evaluation framework, which deploys a suite of adaptive attack techniques to run continuously against past, current, and future versions of Gemini. We describe how these ongoing evaluations directly help make Gemini more resilient against manipulation.



## **19. Adverseness vs. Equilibrium: Exploring Graph Adversarial Resilience through Dynamic Equilibrium**

cs.LG

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14463v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14463v1)

**Authors**: Xinxin Fan, Wenxiong Chen, Mengfan Li, Wenqi Wei, Ling Liu

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks to graph analytics are gaining increased attention. To date, two lines of countermeasures have been proposed to resist various graph adversarial attacks from the perspectives of either graph per se or graph neural networks. Nevertheless, a fundamental question lies in whether there exists an intrinsic adversarial resilience state within a graph regime and how to find out such a critical state if exists. This paper contributes to tackle the above research questions from three unique perspectives: i) we regard the process of adversarial learning on graph as a complex multi-object dynamic system, and model the behavior of adversarial attack; ii) we propose a generalized theoretical framework to show the existence of critical adversarial resilience state; and iii) we develop a condensed one-dimensional function to capture the dynamic variation of graph regime under perturbations, and pinpoint the critical state through solving the equilibrium point of dynamic system. Multi-facet experiments are conducted to show our proposed approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art defense methods under five commonly-used real-world datasets and three representative attacks.



## **20. Vulnerability of Transfer-Learned Neural Networks to Data Reconstruction Attacks in Small-Data Regime**

cs.CR

27 pages

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14323v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14323v1)

**Authors**: Tomasz Maciążek, Robert Allison

**Abstract**: Training data reconstruction attacks enable adversaries to recover portions of a released model's training data. We consider the attacks where a reconstructor neural network learns to invert the (random) mapping between training data and model weights. Prior work has shown that an informed adversary with access to released model's weights and all but one training data point can achieve high-quality reconstructions in this way. However, differential privacy can defend against such an attack with little to no loss in model's utility when the amount of training data is sufficiently large. In this work we consider a more realistic adversary who only knows the distribution from which a small training dataset has been sampled and who attacks a transfer-learned neural network classifier that has been trained on this dataset. We exhibit an attack that works in this realistic threat model and demonstrate that in the small-data regime it cannot be defended against by DP-SGD without severely damaging the classifier accuracy. This raises significant concerns about the use of such transfer-learned classifiers when protection of training-data is paramount. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our attack on VGG, EfficientNet and ResNet image classifiers transfer-learned on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA respectively. Additionally, we point out that the commonly used (true-positive) reconstruction success rate metric fails to reliably quantify the actual reconstruction effectiveness. Instead, we make use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to construct the receiver operating characteristic curve and consider the associated true-positive reconstruction rate at a fixed level of the false-positive reconstruction rate.

**Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, their security remains a pressing concern. One major threat is jailbreak attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2) poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content. To tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions: (1) ICE, a novel black-box jailbreak method that employs Intent Concealment and divErsion to effectively circumvent security constraints. ICE achieves high attack success rates (ASR) with a single query, significantly improving efficiency and transferability across different models. (2) BiSceneEval, a comprehensive dataset designed for assessing LLM robustness in question-answering and text-generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ICE outperforms existing jailbreak techniques, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. Our findings underscore the necessity of a hybrid security strategy that integrates predefined security mechanisms with real-time semantic decomposition to enhance the security of LLMs.



## **22. EVA: Red-Teaming GUI Agents via Evolving Indirect Prompt Injection**

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14289v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14289v1)

**Authors**: Yijie Lu, Tianjie Ju, Manman Zhao, Xinbei Ma, Yuan Guo, ZhuoSheng Zhang

**Abstract**: As multimodal agents are increasingly trained to operate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete user tasks, they face a growing threat from indirect prompt injection, attacks in which misleading instructions are embedded into the agent's visual environment, such as popups or chat messages, and misinterpreted as part of the intended task. A typical example is environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response. Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models, revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal decision making.



## **23. Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks for Flexible Control of Speech-LLMs**

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14286v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14286v1)

**Authors**: Rao Ma, Mengjie Qian, Vyas Raina, Mark Gales, Kate Knill

**Abstract**: The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal, adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance to adversarial attacks.

**Authors**: Liwen Wang, Wenxuan Wang, Shuai Wang, Zongjie Li, Zhenlan Ji, Zongyi Lyu, Daoyuan Wu, Shing-Chi Cheung

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.

**Authors**: Xiangyu Hui, Samuel Karumba, Sid Chi-Kin Chau, Mohiuddin Ahmed

**Abstract**: Cyberattacks on smart inverters and distributed PV are becoming an imminent threat, because of the recent well-documented vulnerabilities and attack incidents. Particularly, the long lifespan of inverter devices, users' oblivion of cybersecurity compliance, and the lack of cyber regulatory frameworks exacerbate the prospect of cyberattacks on smart inverters. As a result, this raises a question -- "do cyberattacks on smart inverters, if orchestrated on a large scale, pose a genuine threat of wide-scale instability to the power grid and energy market"? This paper provides a realistic assessment on the plausibility and impacts of wide-scale power instability caused by cyberattacks on smart inverters. We conduct an in-depth study based on the electricity market data of Australia and the knowledge of practical contingency mechanisms. Our key findings reveal: (1) Despite the possibility of disruption to the grid by cyberattacks on smart inverters, the impact is only significant under careful planning and orchestration. (2) While the grid can assure certain power system security to survive inadvertent contingency events, it is insufficient to defend against savvy attackers who can orchestrate attacks in an adversarial manner. Our data analysis of Australia's electricity grid also reveals that a relatively low percentage of distributed PV would be sufficient to launch an impactful concerted attack on the grid. Our study casts insights on robust strategies for defending the grid in the presence of cyberattacks for places with high penetration of distributed PV.



## **26. Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM) for Extremely Robust Physical Layer Encryption**

**SubmitDate**: 2025-05-20    [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14153v1) [paper-pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14153v1)

**Authors**: Thrassos K. Oikonomou, George K. Karagiannidis

**Abstract**: This paper introduces Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM), a novel modulation scheme that can be leveraged to effectively shuffle transmitted data while maintaining symbol error probability (SEP) performance equivalent to unencrypted systems. By utilizing the well-distributed elliptic curve points over the field of large primes, ECM enhances symbol obfuscation, making it a powerful foundation for physical-layer encryption (PLE). Each symbol is mapped from a predefined key while preserving a minimum Euclidean distance constraint, ensuring strong security against adversarial inference without compromising error performance. Building on ECM's strong obfuscation capabilities, we propose ECM with dynamic rotation (ECM-DR) as a practical PLE scheme that achieves near-maximal obfuscation while balancing precomputation complexity. By leveraging a reduced subset of precomputed elliptic curve points and key-based dynamic constellation rotation, ECM-DR ensures that each transmission remains unpredictable, significantly enhancing security compared to traditional PLE schemes without additional computational cost. Security analysis confirms ECM's resilience to brute-force attacks, while numerical results demonstrate its strong obfuscation capabilities. Furthermore, ECM-DR achieves near-maximum information entropy while preserving the SEP performance of unencrypted quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), offering an extremely robust solution for secure wireless communications.

**Authors**: Jialin Wan, Jinglong Shen, Nan Cheng, Zhisheng Yin, Yiliang Liu, Wenchao Xu, Xuemin, Shen

**Abstract**: This paper investigates backdoor attacks in image-oriented semantic communications. The threat of backdoor attacks on symbol reconstruction in semantic communication (SemCom) systems has received limited attention. Previous research on backdoor attacks targeting SemCom symbol reconstruction primarily focuses on input-level triggers, which are impractical in scenarios with strict input constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel channel-triggered backdoor attack (CT-BA) framework that exploits inherent wireless channel characteristics as activation triggers. Our key innovation involves utilizing fundamental channel statistics parameters, specifically channel gain with different fading distributions or channel noise with different power, as potential triggers. This approach enhances stealth by eliminating explicit input manipulation, provides flexibility through trigger selection from diverse channel conditions, and enables automatic activation via natural channel variations without adversary intervention. We extensively evaluate CT-BA across four joint source-channel coding (JSCC) communication system architectures and three benchmark datasets. Simulation results demonstrate that our attack achieves near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining effective stealth. Finally, we discuss potential defense mechanisms against such attacks.



## **28. Memory Assignment for Finite-Memory Strategies in Adversarial Patrolling Games**

**Authors**: Vojtěch Kůr, Vít Musil, Vojtěch Řehák

**Abstract**: Adversarial Patrolling games form a subclass of Security games where a Defender moves between locations, guarding vulnerable targets. The main algorithmic problem is constructing a strategy for the Defender that minimizes the worst damage an Attacker can cause. We focus on the class of finite-memory (also known as regular) Defender's strategies that experimentally outperformed other competing classes. A finite-memory strategy can be seen as a positional strategy on a finite set of states. Each state consists of a pair of a location and a certain integer value--called memory. Existing algorithms improve the transitional probabilities between the states but require that the available memory size itself is assigned at each location manually. Choosing the right memory assignment is a well-known open and hard problem that hinders the usability of finite-memory strategies. We solve this issue by developing a general method that iteratively changes the memory assignment. Our algorithm can be used in connection with \emph{any} black-box strategy optimization tool. We evaluate our method on various experiments and show its robustness by solving instances of various patrolling models.

**Authors**: Henrique Musseli Cezar, Tilmann Bodenstein, Henrik Andersen Sveinsson, Morten Ledum, Simen Reine, Sigbjørn Løland Bore

**Abstract**: Adversarial approaches, which intentionally challenge machine learning models by generating difficult examples, are increasingly being adopted to improve machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While already providing great practical value, little is known about the actual prediction errors of MLIPs on adversarial structures and whether these errors can be controlled. We propose the Calibrated Adversarial Geometry Optimization (CAGO) algorithm to discover adversarial structures with user-assigned errors. Through uncertainty calibration, the estimated uncertainty of MLIPs is unified with real errors. By performing geometry optimization for calibrated uncertainty, we reach adversarial structures with the user-assigned target MLIP prediction error. Integrating with active learning pipelines, we benchmark CAGO, demonstrating stable MLIPs that systematically converge structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties for liquid water and water adsorption in a metal-organic framework within only hundreds of training structures, where previously many thousands were typically required.

**Authors**: Soichiro Kumano, Hiroshi Kera, Toshihiko Yamasaki

**Abstract**: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we show that transformers adversarially pretrained on diverse tasks can serve as robust foundation models and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context demonstrations. The code is available at https://github.com/s-kumano/universally-robust-in-context-learner.

**Authors**: Adam Štorek, Mukur Gupta, Noopur Bhatt, Aditya Gupta, Janie Kim, Prashast Srivastava, Suman Jana

**Abstract**: AI coding assistants are widely used for tasks like code generation. These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.

**Authors**: Diego Ortiz Barbosa, Luis Burbano, Carlos Hernandez, Zengxiang Lei, Younghee Park, Satish Ukkusuri, Alvaro A Cardenas

**Abstract**: Intelligent mechanisms implemented in autonomous vehicles, such as proactive driving assist and collision alerts, reduce traffic accidents. However, verifying their correct functionality is difficult due to complex interactions with the environment. This problem is exacerbated in adversarial environments, where an attacker can control the environment surrounding autonomous vehicles to exploit vulnerabilities.   To preemptively identify vulnerabilities in these systems, in this paper, we implement a scenario-based framework with a formal method to identify the impact of malicious drivers interacting with autonomous vehicles. The formalization of the evaluation requirements utilizes metric temporal logic (MTL) to identify a safety condition that we want to test. Our goal is to find, through a rigorous testing approach, any trace that violates this MTL safety specification. Our results can help designers identify the range of safe operational behaviors that prevent malicious drivers from exploiting the autonomous features of modern vehicles.

**Authors**: Yingdan Shi, Sijia Liu, Ren Wang

**Abstract**: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of specified data from a trained model. While metrics such as unlearning accuracy (UA) and membership inference attack (MIA) provide baselines for assessing unlearning performance, they fall short of evaluating the forgetting reliability. In this paper, we find that the data misclassified across UA and MIA still have their ground truth labels included in the prediction set from the uncertainty quantification perspective, which raises a fake unlearning issue. To address this issue, we propose two novel metrics inspired by conformal prediction that more reliably evaluate forgetting quality. Building on these insights, we further propose a conformal prediction-based unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction into Carlini & Wagner adversarial attack loss, which can significantly push the ground truth label out of the conformal prediction set. Through extensive experiments on image classification task, we demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and the superiority of our unlearning framework, which improves the UA of existing unlearning methods by an average of 6.6% through the incorporation of a tailored loss term alone.

**Authors**: Jingzheng Li, Tiancheng Wang, Xingyu Peng, Jiacheng Chen, Zhijun Chen, Bing Li, Xianglong Liu

**Abstract**: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems demand the high levels of safety assurance. Despite significant advancements in AD demonstrated on open-source benchmarks like Longest6 and Bench2Drive, existing datasets still lack regulatory-compliant scenario libraries for closed-loop testing to comprehensively evaluate the functional safety of AD. Meanwhile, real-world AD accidents are underrepresented in current driving datasets. This scarcity leads to inadequate evaluation of AD performance, posing risks to safety validation and practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose Safety2Drive, a safety-critical scenario library designed to evaluate AD systems. Safety2Drive offers three key contributions. (1) Safety2Drive comprehensively covers the test items required by standard regulations and contains 70 AD function test items. (2) Safety2Drive supports the safety-critical scenario generalization. It has the ability to inject safety threats such as natural environment corruptions and adversarial attacks cross camera and LiDAR sensors. (3) Safety2Drive supports multi-dimensional evaluation. In addition to the evaluation of AD systems, it also supports the evaluation of various perception tasks, such as object detection and lane detection. Safety2Drive provides a paradigm from scenario construction to validation, establishing a standardized test framework for the safe deployment of AD.

**Authors**: Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Linghao Feng, Xiang He, Jihang Wang, Sicheng Shen, Haibo Tong, Yiting Dong, Jindong Li, Xiang Zheng, Yi Zeng

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms, along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches, requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs, and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

**Authors**: Lucas Rosenblatt, Bin Han, Robert Wolfe, Bill Howe

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through memorization and membership inference attacks. Prior work has primarily focused on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example, if an attacker knows a patient has "hypertension," under what conditions can they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has "osteoarthritis?" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM, which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples from both medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.

**Authors**: Kaan Kale, Kyle Mylonakis, Jay Roberts, Sidhartha Roy

**Abstract**: In this work, we consider an inversion attack on the obfuscated input embeddings sent to a language model on a server, where the adversary has no access to the language model or the obfuscation mechanism and sees only the obfuscated embeddings along with the model's embedding table. We propose BeamClean, an inversion attack that jointly estimates the noise parameters and decodes token sequences by integrating a language-model prior. Against Laplacian and Gaussian obfuscation mechanisms, BeamClean always surpasses naive distance-based attacks. This work highlights the necessity for and robustness of more advanced learned, input-dependent methods.

**Authors**: Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka, Julian Ma, Thomas Thiery

**Abstract**: Censorship resistance is one of the core value proposition of blockchains. A recurring design pattern aimed at providing censorship resistance is enabling multiple proposers to contribute inputs into block construction. Notably, Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) is proposed to be included in Ethereum. However, the current proposal relies on altruistic behavior, without a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM). This study aims to address this gap by exploring how multiple proposers should be rewarded to incentivize censorship resistance. The main contribution of this work is the identification of TFMs that ensure censorship resistance under bribery attacks, while also satisfying the incentive compatibility properties of EIP-1559. We provide a concrete payment mechanism for FOCIL, along with generalizable contributions to the literature by analyzing 1) incentive compatibility of TFMs in the presence of a bribing adversary, 2) TFMs in protocols with multiple phases of transaction inclusion, and 3) TFMs of protocols in which parties are uncertain about the behavior and the possible bribe of others.

**Authors**: Dang Huu-Tien, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Anh Bui, Le-Minh Nguyen, Naoya Inoue

**Abstract**: In this paper, we show that current state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we reframe the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in unlearned models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose Random Noise Augmentation (RNA) -- a plug-and-play, model and method agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of unlearned models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of unlearned models, maintains unlearning performances while introducing no additional computational overhead.

**Authors**: Lucas Beerens, Alex D. Richardson, Kaicheng Zhang, Dongdong Chen

**Abstract**: The proliferation of text-to-image diffusion models has raised significant privacy and security concerns, particularly regarding the generation of copyrighted or harmful images. In response, several concept erasure (defense) methods have been developed to prevent the generation of unwanted content through post-hoc finetuning. On the other hand, concept restoration (attack) methods seek to recover supposedly erased concepts via adversarially crafted prompts. However, all existing restoration methods only succeed in the highly restrictive scenario of finding adversarial prompts tailed to some fixed seed. To address this, we introduce RECORD, a novel coordinate-descent-based restoration algorithm that finds adversarial prompts to recover erased concepts independently of the seed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate RECORD consistently outperforms the current restoration methods by up to 17.8 times in this setting. Our findings further reveal the susceptibility of unlearned models to restoration attacks, providing crucial insights into the behavior of unlearned models under the influence of adversarial prompts.

**Authors**: Narek Maloyan, Bislan Ashinov, Dmitry Namiot

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators (LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns. This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies: Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based assessment frameworks.

**Abstract**: Despite significant advancements in the area, adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in systems employing machine learning models. The removal of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this, state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats, while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.

**Abstract**: It is imperative to safeguard computer applications and information systems against the growing number of cyber-attacks. Automated software testing tools can be developed to quickly analyze many lines of code and detect vulnerabilities by generating function-specific testing data. This process draws similarities to the constrained adversarial examples generated by adversarial machine learning methods, so there could be significant benefits to the integration of these methods in testing tools to identify possible attack vectors. Therefore, this literature review is focused on the current state-of-the-art of constrained data generation approaches applied for adversarial learning and software testing, aiming to guide researchers and developers to enhance their software testing tools with adversarial testing methods and improve the resilience and robustness of their information systems. The found approaches were systematized, and the advantages and limitations of those specific for white-box, grey-box, and black-box testing were analyzed, identifying research gaps and opportunities to automate the testing tools with data generated by adversarial attacks.

**Abstract**: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by injecting sophisticated designed perturbations to input data. Training-time defenses still exhibit a significant performance gap between natural accuracy and robust accuracy. In this paper, we investigate a new test-time adversarial defense method via diffusion-based recovery along opposite adversarial paths (OAPs). We present a purifier that can be plugged into a pre-trained model to resist adversarial attacks. Different from prior arts, the key idea is excessive denoising or purification by integrating the opposite adversarial direction with reverse diffusion to push the input image further toward the opposite adversarial direction. For the first time, we also exemplify the pitfall of conducting AutoAttack (Rand) for diffusion-based defense methods. Through the lens of time complexity, we examine the trade-off between the effectiveness of adaptive attack and its computation complexity against our defense. Experimental evaluation along with time cost analysis verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Abstract**: We present a countermeasure against the detector blinding attack (DBA) utilizing statistical analysis of error and double-click events accumulated during a quantum key distribution session under randomized modulation of single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detection efficiencies via gate voltage manipulation. Building upon prior work demonstrating the ineffectiveness of this countermeasure against continuous-wave (CW) DBA, we extend the analysis to evaluate its performance against pulsed DBA. Our findings reveal an approximately 25 dB increase in the trigger pulse energies difference between high and low gate voltage applied under pulsed DBA conditions compared to CW DBA. This heightened difference enables a re-evaluation of the feasibility of utilizing SPAD detection probability variations as a countermeasure and makes it possible to estimate the fraction of bits compromised by an adversary during pulsed DBA.

**Authors**: Reda Bellafqira, Gouenou Coatrieux

**Abstract**: Deep neural network (DNN) watermarking is a suitable method for protecting the ownership of deep learning (DL) models. It secretly embeds an identifier (watermark) within the model, which can be retrieved by the owner to prove ownership. In this paper, we first provide a unified framework for white box DNN watermarking schemes. It includes current state-of-the-art methods outlining their theoretical inter-connections. Next, we introduce DICTION, a new white-box Dynamic Robust watermarking scheme, we derived from this framework. Its main originality stands on a generative adversarial network (GAN) strategy where the watermark extraction function is a DNN trained as a GAN discriminator taking the target model to watermark as a GAN generator with a latent space as the input of the GAN trigger set. DICTION can be seen as a generalization of DeepSigns which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only other Dynamic white-box watermarking scheme from the literature. Experiments conducted on the same model test set as Deepsigns demonstrate that our scheme achieves much better performance. Especially, with DICTION, one can increase the watermark capacity while preserving the target model accuracy at best and simultaneously ensuring strong watermark robustness against a wide range of watermark removal and detection attacks.

**Authors**: Danqing Chen, Tobias Ladner, Ahmed Rayen Mhadhbi, Matthias Althoff

**Abstract**: As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success, large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions, posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment and content moderation.

**Authors**: Yige Li, Hanxun Huang, Yunhan Zhao, Xingjun Ma, Jun Sun

**Abstract**: Generative large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of tasks, yet they remain susceptible to backdoor attacks: carefully crafted triggers in the input can manipulate the model to produce adversary-specified outputs. While prior research has predominantly focused on backdoor risks in vision and classification settings, the vulnerability of LLMs in open-ended text generation remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorLLM (Our BackdoorLLM benchmark was awarded First Prize in the SafetyBench competition, https://www.mlsafety.org/safebench/winners, organized by the Center for AI Safety, https://safe.ai/.), the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor threats in text-generation LLMs. BackdoorLLM provides: (i) a unified repository of benchmarks with a standardized training and evaluation pipeline; (ii) a diverse suite of attack modalities, including data poisoning, weight poisoning, hidden-state manipulation, and chain-of-thought hijacking; (iii) over 200 experiments spanning 8 distinct attack strategies, 7 real-world scenarios, and 6 model architectures; (iv) key insights into the factors that govern backdoor effectiveness and failure modes in LLMs; and (v) a defense toolkit encompassing 7 representative mitigation techniques. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/bboylyg/BackdoorLLM. We will continuously incorporate emerging attack and defense methodologies to support the research in advancing the safety and reliability of LLMs.



## **49. Bullying the Machine: How Personas Increase LLM Vulnerability**

**Authors**: Ziwei Xu, Udit Sanghi, Mohan Kankanhalli

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactions where they are prompted to adopt personas. This paper investigates whether such persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware safety evaluation and alignment strategies.

**Authors**: Seungmin Kim, Sohee Park, Donghyun Kim, Jisu Lee, Daeseon Choi

**Abstract**: With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo (Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals, reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat.   In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack. Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat scenarios.
